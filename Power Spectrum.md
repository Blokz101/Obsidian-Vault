- ## Definition
	- The [[Power Spectrum]] of a [[Periodic Signal]] indicates the relative [[Magnitude|Magnitudes]] of the [[Frequency]] components that combine to make up the signal.
	- The [[Power Spectrum]] is in the [[Frequency]] domain.
	- The [[Fourier Series]] states that any [[Periodic Signal]] can be made up of an infinite sum of [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)]]. 
		- To plot the power of each of the [[Harmonic|Harmonics]] of the [[Fourier Series]] the [[Power]] must be normalized.
		- To do this he [[Power]] formula $P=\frac{V_{rms}^2}{R}$
