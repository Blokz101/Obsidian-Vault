#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^0819c0
	- [[Solid|Solids]] held together by a large number of **inter-particle** [[Covalent Compound|Covalent Bonds]].
	- Has a [[Boiling and Melting Point]] because of the large number of bonds.
	- You can tell if a [[Solid]] is a [[Network Covalent Solid]] because the [[Element|Elements]] will be or will be near the [[Metalloid|Metalloids]].
- ## Types
	- Graphite
		- Layers of carbon held together loosely by [[Hybridization Theory|Unhybridized P Orbitals]].
		- Makes a good lubricant.
	- Diamond
		- Hardest substance currently known, because of the sheer number of [[Covalent Compound|Covalent Bonds]].
	- Zinc Blende
		- Good [[Semi Conductor]].
	- Cristobalite ($SiO_2$)
		- Natural high temp glass.
