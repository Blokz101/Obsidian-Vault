- ## Definition
	- Symbol: $\omega$
	- [[Angular Velocity]] is essentially [[Radians]] per second.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}}$$
		  > 
		  > $\omega$ = [[Angular Velocity]] in $\frac{rad}{s}$
		  > $T$ = [[Period]] of the rotating object in $s$
	- Because we know the circumference and [[Period]] we can calculate regular [[Velocity]] as well.
