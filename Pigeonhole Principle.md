- ## Definition
	- > The pigeonhole principle is a mathematical tool used to establish that repetitions are guaranteed to occur in certain sets and sequences. The pigeonhole principle says that if $n+1$ pigeons are placed in $n$ boxes, then there must be at least one box with more than one pigeon. The image below shows $10$ pigeons placed in $9$ boxes.

	- If $n$ pigeons are placed in $k$ boxes then there is at least one box that has $\left\lceil  \frac{n}{k}  \right\rceil$ pigeons in it.
		- See [[Ceiling Function]] if $\lceil x \rceil$ is unfamiliar.
	- To quickly count the number of pigeons required to ensure there are more then one pigeon in one hole
