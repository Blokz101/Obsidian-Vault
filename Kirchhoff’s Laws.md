- ## Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
	- States the the sum of the voltages on a closed loop will always equal 0.
		- In other words, voltage in will always equal voltage out.
- ## Kirchhoff’s Current Law
	- States that the sum of the currents on a closed loop will always equal 0.
		- In other words, current in will always equal current out.
