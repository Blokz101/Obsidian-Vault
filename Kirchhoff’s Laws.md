- ## Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)
	- States the the sum of the voltages on a closed loop will always equal 0.
		> [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\sum^{N}_{n=1}V_{n}=0}$$
		  > $N$ = Number of [[Component|Components]] in the chosen [[Loop]]
		  > $n$ = Index of [[Component]] in the chosen [[Loop]]
		  > $V_{n}$ = [[Voltage]] of [[Component]] at index $n$
		- In other words, voltage in will always equal voltage out.

- ## Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
	- States that the sum of the currents on a closed loop will always equal 0.
	  > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\sum^{N}_{n=1}I_{n}=0}$$
		  > $N$ = Number of wires at [[Node]]
		  > $n$ = Index of [[Component]] in the chosen [[Loop]]
		  > $v_{n}$ = [[Voltage]] of [[Component]] at index $n$
		- In other words, current in will always equal current out.
