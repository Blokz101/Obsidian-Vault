- ## Definition
	- Symbol is $\sigma$
	- The inverse of [[Resistivity]]. ( $\sigma=\frac{1}{R}$)
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\sigma=|q|nu}$$
	  > $\sigma$ = [[Conductivity]] in $\frac{A}{m^2}/\frac{V}{m}$
	  > $q$ = The [[Charge]] on each carrier in $C$
	  > $n$ = The number of [[Charge|Charges]] in $?$
	  > $u$ = The mobility of the charge carriers in $\frac{m}{s} / \frac{V}{m}$
