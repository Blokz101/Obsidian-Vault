- ## Definition
	- A macroscopic measure of the "stretchability" of a material.
	- Defined as **stress** over **strain**.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\text{Stress}=\frac{F_{t}}{A}$$
		  > $$\text{Strain}=\frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
		  > $$\large{Y=\frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}}=\frac{\left( \frac{F_{t}}{A} \right)}{\left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)}}$$
		  > 
		  > $F_{t}$ = [[Tension Force]] in $N$
		  > $A$ = The **area** of a **cross section** in $m^2$
		  > $L$ = The **resting length** of the material in $L$
		  > $\Delta L$ = The amount the material stretched past $L$ in $m$
	- To find the atomic bond [[Hooke's Law (Physics)|Spring Stiffness (Physics)]] we can use this equation:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{Y=\frac{k_{b}}{d}}$$
		  > 
		  > $k_{s}$ = [[Hooke's Law (Physics)|Spring Constant (Physics)]] of an atomic bond
		  > $d$ = Diameter of an [[Atom]] in $m$
