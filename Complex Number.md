- ## Definition
	- Numbers containing [[Imaginary Number|Imaginary Numbers]] and [[Real Number|Real Numbers]].
	- Every [[Complex Number]] can be broken into a **real part** and **imaginary part** by formatting them like this:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > Cartesian Representation
		>  $$\large{z=a+b i}$$
		  > or 
		  > $$\large{z=a+b j}$$
		  > 
		  > $z$ = [[Complex Number]]
		  > $a$ = Real part
		  > $b$ = Imaginary part
- #### Polar Representation
	- [[Complex Number|Complex Numbers]] can also be represented on a Polar Graph:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{z=\rho(z)\angle\theta(z)}$$
	  > 
	  > $z$ = [[Complex Number]]
	  > $\rho$ = Radius
	  > $\theta$ = Angle
- #### Exponential Representation
