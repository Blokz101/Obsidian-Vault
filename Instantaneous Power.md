- ## Definition
	- The rate at witch [[Work (Physics)]] is done.
	  > [!Equation] 
	  > $$P(t)=\frac{dW}{dt}$$
	  > or
	  > $$\large{P(t)=V(t)I(t)}$$
	  > 
	  > $P(t)$ = [[Instantaneous Power]] as a function of time in $W$
	  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] in $J$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $V(t)$ = [[Voltage]] as a function of time in $V$
	  > $I(t)$ = [[Current]] as a function of time in $A$
	  > 
	  > > [!Warning]
	  > > [[Real Power]] and [[Instantaneous Power]] are technically **power dissipation**. 
	  > > 
	  > > This means that when performing [[Circuit Analysis]] to solve for the [[Real Power]] of an **energy source**, multiply the equation above by $-1$.
	  > > 
	  > > In other words, energy sources produce negative [[Real Power]].
