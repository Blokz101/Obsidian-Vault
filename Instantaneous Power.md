- ## Definition
	- The rate at witch [[Work (Physics)]] is done.

	  > 
	  > $P(t)$ = [[Instantaneous Power]] as a function of time in $W$
	  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] in $J$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $v(t)$ = [[Voltage]] as a function of time in $V$
	  > $i(t)$ = [[Current]] as a function of time in $A$

- #### AC Instantaneous Power
	- Same as the equation above, but $v(t)$ and $i(t)$ are [[Sinusoidal Signal|Sinusoidal Signals]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $\large{v(t)=V_{m}\cos(\omega t+\theta_{v})}$
		  > $\large{i(t)=I_{m}\cos(\omega t+\theta_{i})}$
		  > 
		- 
		  > $V_{m}$/$I_{m}$ = Magnitude of the signal.
