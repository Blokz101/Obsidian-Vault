- ## Definition
	- A method of determining if a [[Critical Point (Calculus)]] is a **maximum** or **minimum**.
- ## Single Variable Function
	- Take the second [[Derivative]] of the function.
		- If it is greater then 0, it is [[Concavity|Concave Up]] and a **minimum**
		- If it is less then 0, it is [[Concavity|Concave Down]] and a **maximum**
- ## Multi Variable Function
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{D=f_{xx}f_{yy}-(f_{xy})^2}$$
	  > 
	  > If $D>0$ and $f_{xx}>0$ it is a **minimum**
	  > If $D>0$ and $f_{xx}<0$ it is a **maximum**
	  > If $D<0$ it is a **saddle point**
	  > If $D=0$ the test is inclusive
