#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The amount of [[Energy]] that is required to remove an [[Electron]] from an isolated [[Atom]] or [[Molecule]].
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$IE=+\frac{Z_{eff}^2}{n^2}$$
	  > 
	  > $IE$ = [[Ionization Energy]] (Units Unknown)
	  > $n$ = [[Principle Quantum Number]] ([[Integer]])
	  > $Z_{eff}$ = [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] (Units Unknown)
- ## Reference
	- [[Effective Nuclear Charge Related Trends]]
	- Has the same equation as [[Electronegativity]].
	- Has the same equation as [[Energy]], just negative.
