- ## Definition
	- How often a wave passes in a second.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$v=\frac{S}{\lambda}$$
	  > 
	  > $S$ = [[Speed of Light]] (m/s) = $3.0e8m/s$
	  > $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]] (m)
	  > $v$ = [[Frequency Of Light]] ([[Hertz]])
	  > 
	  > The speed of light is **CONSTANT**
- ## Practice
	- [[Drawing 2022-09-04 15.09.53.excalidraw]]
- ## Reference
	- A characteristic if a wave on the [[Spectrum of Light]].
	- [[Frequency Of Light]] and [[Wavelength]] are **Inversely** related.
	- [[Energy (Chemistry)]] and [[Frequency Of Light]] are **Directly** related.
