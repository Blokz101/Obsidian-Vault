#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A diagram that shows the [[States Of Matter|State of Matter]] of a [[Molecule]] as [[Pressure]] and [[Temperature]] increases.
	- ![[IMG_BBC30CD9E12E-1.jpeg|400]]
	- Points on the lines are places where the states of [[States Of Matter]] are in equilibrium with each other.
		- The blue line is equally [[Solid]] and [[Liquid]].
		- The purple line is equally [[Solid]] and [[Gas]].
		- The red line is equally [[Liquid]] and [[Gas]]. ^e77e56
- ## Reference
	- [[Molecule|Molecules]] with **stronger** [[Intramolecular Forces]] stays a [[Liquid]] or [[Solid]] **longer**.
	- A fluid becomes a [[Supercritical Fluid]] when it exceeds the max [[Temperature]] and [[Pressure]] on the diagram.
	- Deals with the [[States Of Matter]].
