#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Notated as **$\Delta G$**.
		- **$\Delta G\degree$** or **Delta G Not** is **$\Delta G$** at **standard** conditions.
			- **$\Delta G$** represents the [[Free Energy]] of a reaction **in real time** or at any given point.
			- **$\Delta G\degree$** represents the [[Free Energy]] of a reaction at only **standard conditions**. This **value is constant** because its conditions never change.
			- As a reaction approaches its [[Equilibrium]] **$\Delta G$** approaches 0 but **$\Delta G\degree$** remains at its constant predetermined value.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\Delta G = \Delta G\degree+RT*ln(K)$$
		  > 
		  > $\Delta G$ = [[Free Energy]] in [[Energy (Chemistry)|J]]
		  > $\Delta G\degree$ = [[Free Energy]] in **standard conditions** in [[Energy (Chemistry)|J]]
		  > $R$ = [[Ideal Gas Constant]]
		  > $T$ = [[Temperature]] in [[Temperature|K]]
		  > $K$ = [[Equilibrium Constant]]
	- The amount of [[Work (Chemistry)]] a chemical **system** can do.
		- Dependent on [[Entropy]] and [[Enthalpy]].
		- ![[Thermodynamics#^3dc3fc]]
	- If this value negative the reaction is [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] and will be an [[Exothermic Process]].
