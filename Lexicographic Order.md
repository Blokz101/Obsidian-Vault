- ## Definition
	- A method of ordering $n$-tuples in which two $n$-tuples are compared according to the first entry where they differ.
	  > [!Example]
	  > Words in a dictionary are ordered in a [[Lexicographic Order]]. For example, the word "comment" appears before the word "compare" because the first place where the two words differ is the 4th character and "m" appears before "p" in the alphabet. Although words of different lengths can be ordered lexicographically.
		- We will only work with $n$-tuples of the same length.
