- ## Definition
	- A lot like [[Infinite Series]] but with another variable $x$:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}c_{n}x^n}$$
	- For all values of $x$ where the [[Power Series]] **converges**, it converges to some unique number, therefore we can define it as a **function** as well:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$f(x)=\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}c_{n}x^n}$$
	- The goal of most of them is to find the intervals on which the [[Power Series]] **converges**.
	- We can use the tests from [[Series Convergence Tests]] to help.
