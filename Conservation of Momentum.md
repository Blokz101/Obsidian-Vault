- ## Definition
	- Uses [[The Momentum Principle]] to conclude that **the [[Momentum]] of the entire universe is constant** because **no external force can act on it**.
	- Using the same reasoning you can conclude that as long as **no external force acts on a system, its [[Momentum]] will remain constant**.
