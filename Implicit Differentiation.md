- ## Definition
	- The [[Derivative]] of an [[Implicit Function]].
	  
	- Use the same steps for [[Derivative|Derivatives]] except that when you need to take the [[Derivative]] of $f(x)$, simply write it as $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Then solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

- ## Reference
	- Same as [[Derivative|Differentiation]] but works with $f(x)$ in on both sides.
