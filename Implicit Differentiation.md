#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- Use the same steps for [[Derivative|Derivatives]] except that when you need to take the [[Derivative]] of $f(x)$, simply write it as $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $f'(x)$.
	- Then solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $f'(x)$.
- ## Practice
	- [[Drawing 2022-10-01 16.50.33.excalidraw]]
- ## Reference
	- Same as [[Derivative|Differentiation]] but works with $f(x)$ in on both sides.
