- ## Definition
	- How the total [[Probability]]($1.0$) is distributed among all the outcomes in the [[Sample Space]].
		- > Suppose, for example, that a business has just purchased four laser printers, and let X be the number among these that require service during the warranty period. Possible X values are then 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probability distribution will tell us how the probability of 1 is subdivided among these five possible valuesâ€”how much probability is associated with the X value 0, how much is apportioned to the X value 1, and so on.
