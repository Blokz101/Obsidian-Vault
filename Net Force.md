- ## Definition
	- The sum of all the [[Force|Forces]] acting on an object.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{F_{net}=m*a}$$
	  > 
	  > $F_{net}$ = [[Net Force]] in $N$
	  > $m$ = Mass in $g$
	  > $a$ = [[Acceleration]] in $\frac{m}{s^2}$
	- To find the [[Acceleration]] from [[Net Force]] just rearrange the equation above.
