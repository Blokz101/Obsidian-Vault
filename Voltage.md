- ## Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]** of [[Electron|Electrons]] due to [[Charge|Charges]]. In other words, the external [[Work (Physics)]] needed to move a [[Charge]] from one location to another location in an [[Electric Field]].
	- Critically linked to [[Coulomb's Law of Force]].
	- [[Voltage|Volt]] is a unit notated by $v$.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V=\frac{J}{C}}$$
	  > 
	  > $V$ = [[Voltage|Volt]]
	  > $J$ = [[Joule]]
	  > $C$ = [[Coulomb]]
	- We got volts because we needed a standardized way to define the energy between two interacting [[Charge|Charges]].

		  > We need to move $Q_{2}$ far away from $Q_{2}$ until there is basically no interaction between them. This is the [[Work (Physics)]] required and therefore the [[Potential Energy]]:
		  > $$\large{W=U=\int_{0}^{\infty} F(r) \, dr}=kQ_{1}Q_{2}\frac{1}{r}$$
		  > 
		  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] required in $J$
		  > $k$ = Some constant, likely negative [[Coulomb's Constant]] /[[Dielectric Constant]]
		  > $J$ = [[Potential Energy]] in $J$
		  > $Q_{1}$ = [[Charge]] $1$
		  > $Q_{2}$ = [[Charge]] $2$
		  > $F(r)$ = Force as defined by [[Coulomb's Law of Force]] in $N$
		  > $r$ = Distance in $m$
		  > 
		  > The units for this are $\frac{J}{C}$ or [[Voltage|Volts]].
	- Voltage Difference
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V_{a}-V_{b}=\Delta V_{ab}}$$
	  > $$\large{\Delta V_{ab}=kQ \frac{1}{V_{a}}-\frac{1}{V_{b}}}$$
	  > $$\large{\Delta V_{ba}=kQ \frac{1}{V_{a}}-\frac{1}{V_{b}}}$$
- ## Reference
	- Voltage is related to [[Current]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
