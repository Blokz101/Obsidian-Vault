- ## Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]** of [[Electron|Electrons]] due to [[Charge|Charges]]. In other words, the external [[Work (Physics)]] needed to move a [[Charge]] from one location to another location in an [[Electric Field]].

		  > $$\large{V=\frac{\Delta U}{q}}$$
		  > 
		  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] in $V$
		  > $\Delta U$ = [[Potential Energy]] of a [[Charge]] in an [[Electric Field]] in $J$
		  > $q$ = [[Charge]] of object with the [[Potential Energy]] in $C$
		- > [!Equation]
		  > Assuming a **constant** [[Electric Field]] for all of $\vec{r}_{ab}$, [[Potential Energy]] can be substituted in:

		  > $q$ = [[Charge]] of object with the [[Potential Energy]] in $C$
		  > $\vec{r}_{ab}$ = Change in position from point $a$ to point $b$ in $m$

	- **The [[Electric Field]] points in the direction of DECREASING [[Voltage|Electric Potential]]**.
	- [[Voltage]] always refers to **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]**. In these notes it is notated as both $\Delta V$ and $V$ interchangeably. They are the same.
	- [[Voltage|Volt]] is a unit notated by $v$.

	  > $V$ = [[Voltage|Volt]]
	  > $J$ = [[Joule]]
	  > $C$ = [[Coulomb]]
- ## Point Voltage
	- [[Voltage]] is the [[Voltage|Electric Potential Difference]] between two points, however, sometimes it is said that a specific point has some [[Voltage]]. This is referred to as:
		- Point Voltage
		- Voltage with respect to infinity (which is $0$ because when a charge is very far away from everything else it has no potential energy)
