- ## Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]** of [[Electron|Electrons]] due to [[Charge|Charges]].
	- [[Voltage|Volt]] is a unit notated by $v$.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V=\frac{J}{C}}$$
	  > 
	  > $V$ = [[Voltage|Volt]]
	  > $J$ = [[Joule]]
	  > $C$ = [[Coulomb]]
	- We got volts because we needed a standardized way to define the energy between two interacting [[Charge|Charges]].

		  > We need to move $Q_{2}$ far away from $Q_{2}$ until there is basically no interaction between them. This is the [[Work (Physics)]] required and therefore the [[Potential Energy]]:
		  > $$\large{W=U=\int_{0}^{\infty} F(x) \, dx}=kQ_{1}Q_{2}\frac{1}{r}$$
		  > 
		  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] required in $J$
		  > $J$ = [[Potential Energy]] in $J$
		  > $Q_{1}$ = [[Charge]]
		  > The units for this are $\frac{J}{C}$ or [[Voltage|Volts]].
- ## Reference
	- Voltage is related to [[Current]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
