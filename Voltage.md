- ## Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]** of [[Electron|Electrons]] due to [[Charge|Charges]]. In other words, the external [[Work (Physics)]] needed to move a [[Charge]] from one location to another location in an [[Electric Field]].

		- **The [[Electric Field]] points in the direction of DECREASING [[Voltage|Electric Potential]]**.
	- [[Voltage]] always refers to **difference in electrical [[Potential Energy]]**. In these notes it is notated as both $\Delta V$ and $V$ interchangeably. They are the same.
	- [[Voltage|Volt]] is a unit notated by $v$.

	- Volts are the standard measurement of energy between two interacting [[Charge|Charges]]. Same as  [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].

		  > We need to move $Q_{2}$ far away from $Q_{2}$ until there is basically no interaction between them. This is the [[Work (Physics)]] required and therefore the [[Potential Energy]]:

	- Voltage Difference

	  > $$\large{V_{a}-V_{b}=\Delta V_{ab}}$$
	  > $$\large{\Delta V_{ab}=kQ \frac{1}{V_{a}}-\frac{1}{V_{b}}}$$
	  > $$\large{\Delta V_{ba}=kQ \frac{1}{V_{b}}-\frac{1}{V_{a}}}$$
