- ## Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the difference in electrical potential energy of [[Electron|Electrons]] between two points.
		- For example, the positive side of a battery has atomic nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons, the negative side has the electrons. There is a massive electrical potential difference of electrons as the electrons attempt to find a way to get to the nuclei.
	- Voltage is related to [[Current]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
