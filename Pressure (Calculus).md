- ## Definition
	- Generally [[Pressure (Calculus)]] is given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{P=\frac{F}{A}}$$
		  > 
		  > $P$ = [[Pressure (Calculus)]]
		  > $F$ = [[Force]]
		  > $A$ = [[Area]]
		  > 
	- The [[Pressure (Calculus)]] of a **liquid** is given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{P=\rho*d}$$
		  > 
		  > $P$ = [[Pressure (Calculus)]]
		  > $\rho$ = [[Weight Density Constant]]
		  > $d$ = Depth from surface
