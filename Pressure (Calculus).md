- ## Definition
	- Generally [[Pressure (Calculus)]] is given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{P=\frac{F}{A}}$$
		  > 
		  > $P$ = [[Pressure (Calculus)]]
		  > $F$ = [[Force]]
		  > $A$ = [[Area]]
		  > 
	- The [[Pressure (Calculus)]] of a **liquid** is given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{P=\rho*d}$$
		  > 
		  > $P$ = [[Pressure (Calculus)]]
		  > $\rho$ = [[Weight Density Constant]]
		  > $d$ = Depth from surface
	- Rearranging the first formula and combining it with the second we can find the [[Force]] exerted on a plate submerged at some depth.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{F=A*\rho d}$$
		  > 
		  > $F$ = [[Force]]
		  > $A$ = [[Area]]
		  > $\rho$ = [[Weight Density Constant]]
		  > $d$ = Depth from surface
		  > > [!Warning]
		  > > This will require an integral to really find the [[Force]]. This equation is only accurate for some exact **depth**. Basically the [[Force]] exerted on the top of the submerged plate is not the same as the [[Force]] exerted on the bottom of the submerged plate.
