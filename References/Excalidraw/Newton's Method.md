- ## Definition
	- A way to approximate a root for a function by using this formula repeatedly.
	- > [!Equation]
	> $$\large{x_{x+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}}$$
	> 
	> $n$ = The number of the current iteration
	-  Can also be used to approximate values functions at a specific value as well. To do this simply let the root of the function be the value you want to approximate and derive $f(x)$ from there.
