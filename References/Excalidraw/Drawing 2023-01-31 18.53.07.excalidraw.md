# Text Elements
A land yacht is a low mass three-wheeled wind-powered vehicle with a sail. Suppose 
you are in the desert, observing a land yacht race. Consider your location to be the origin. 
When a particular land yacht passes you, it is traveling 11 m/s in the −z direction. If the 
mass of the vehicle plus driver is 174 kg, and the net force on the vehicle remains 
constant at ‹ 0, 0, −28 › N, what is the position of the yacht 27 seconds after it passes you? ^SRkarYWU
