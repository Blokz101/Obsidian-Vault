#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- A way to approximate the $y$ value of a function given the $x$ value.
		- Done by using an **$x$ value with a known $y$ value thats near the desired $x$ value**, and finding the [[Tangent Line]] at that point. Then you can **plug the desired $x$ value into that tangent line** to get an approximation.
