#Permanent [[Calculus I]]

- ## Definition
	- A line that a rational [[Function]] continually approaches but never meets. There are two types, vertical and horizontal.
	  > [!Note]
	  > I am referring to rational function as a function that follows the standard format or format shown below.
	  > $$f(x)=\frac{n(x)}{d(x)}$$
	  > $f(x)$ = The rational function
	  > $n(x)$ = The function in the numerator
	  > $d(x)$ = The function in the  denominator
- ## Vertical
	- Can be found by setting $d(x)$ to $0$ and solving for $x$.
- ## Horizontal
	- 
	  > [!Key]
	  > Rewriting the rational function format above such that the variable term raised to the highest exponent is in front.
	  > $$f(x)=\frac{ax^m+...}{bx^n+...}$$
	  > $f(x)$ = The rational function
	  > $a$ = The coefficient of the variable raised to the highest exponent in the numerator
	  > $m$ = The highest exponent in the numerator
	  > $b$ = The coefficient of the variable raised to the highest exponent in the denominator
	  > $n$ = The highest exponent in the denominator
	  > $...$ = Means that whatever terms follow are irrelevant to finding the [[Asymptote]]
	- There are three cases
		- If $m<n$ then the horizontal [[Asymptote]] is $y=0$.
		- If $m>n$ then there is no horizontal [[Asymptote]].
		- If $m=n$ then the horizontal [[Asymptote]] is $y=\frac{a}{b}$.
