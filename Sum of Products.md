- ## Definition
	- Uses **positive logic**:
		- One [[AND Gate]] for each **1** output.
	- ![[IMG_F881498BEB91-1.jpeg]]
	- To create a logic circuit that will output the given truth table using [[Sum of Products]], focus on the **1** outputs. Place one [[AND Gate]] for each series of inputs that yields a **1**.
		- For example, for the first **1** output, you would want the [[AND Gate]] to activate when **NOT A and B and NOT C**. So add an [[AND Gate]] and place [[NOT Gate|Inverters]] on the **A** and **C** inputs.
