#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Notated as $k_f$ or $k_r$
	- Related to the amount of [[Activation Energy]] required to start the reaction) determines how often they right [[Molecule|Molecules]] will collide in the **right orientation**. See [[Rate of Reaction]].
	- Broken into the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] and the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
		- The [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] determines how fast the reaction will proceed in the forwards direction.
		- The [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] determines how fast the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction.
