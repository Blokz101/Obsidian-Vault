#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Notated as $k$
	- Broken into the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] and the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
		- The [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] determines how fast the reaction will proceed in the forwards direction.
		- The [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] determines how fast the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction.
	- The [[Reaction Rate Constants]] can be determined by the speed at which the **reactants** or **products** can reach the [[Transition State]].
