- ## Definition
	- An [[Infinite Series]] that takes the form of:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^p}}$$
	- We can determine **convergence** with this simple rule:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\text{The P Series Converges if }p>1\text{ and Diverges if }p\leq 1$$
	  > 
	  > > [!Proof]
	  > > We can go through each case of $p$ and use the [[Integral Convergence Test]] to check **convergence** where needed:
