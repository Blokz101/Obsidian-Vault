- ## Definition
	- A [[Periodic Signal]] in the form of:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$V(t)=V_{DC}+A\cos(2\pi ft+\theta)$$
	  > $V(t)$ = [[Voltage]] in terms of time in $V$
	  > $V_{DC}$ = [[Average Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $A$ = [[Amplitude]] in $V$
	  > $f$ = [[Frequency]] in $\frac{1}{s}$
	  > $\theta$ = **Phase** in $s$
	  > 
	  > **Phase** - Basically horizontal offset for the cosine function.
