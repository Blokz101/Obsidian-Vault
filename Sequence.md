- ## Definition
	- A function that yields a list of real numbers. Think of it as an ordered list or array of [[Real Number|Real Numbers]]
		- > [!Example]
		  > $$\large{{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},a_{5},a_{6},a_{7},a_{8},\dots,a_{n}}}$$
- ## Determining Convergence Or Divergence
	- Determining if a [[Sequence]] **converges** or **diverges** tells us a lot about the sequence, including if we can find the overall sum of the [[Sequence]].
	- There are several minor and major theorems that can help us determine this.
	- > [!Theorem]
	  > Let $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ be two [[Sequence|Sequences]]. If:
	  > $$\large{a_{n}=b_{n+k}}$$
	  > Then:
	  > $$\large{\lim_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}}$$
