- ## Definition
	- [[Current]] is how much [[Charge]] moves per unit of time.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{I=\frac{dq}{dt}}$$
	  > 
	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	- Symbol is $I$
	- Current is related to [[Voltage]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
	  ![[Ohm's Law#^1c650e]]
	- Taking a look on a more microscopic level yields this equation:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{I=nA\mu E}$$
	  > 
	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
	  > $n$ = Number of [[Electron|Electrons]] in the wire or [[Electron]] Density in $m^3$
	  > $A$ = Cross-sectional Area of Wire in $m^2$
	  > $E$ = [[Electric Field]] in the wire due to [[Voltage|Electric Potential Difference]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > 
	  > Note that [[Drift Speed]] can be substituted in for $\mu E$.
