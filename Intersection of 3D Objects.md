- ## Intersection of Two Vectors
	- To check if two [[Vector|Vectors]] intersect you need to first check if the two [[Vector|Vectors]] are parallel. 
		- Two vectors are parallel if one is a multiple of the other.
		  > [!Equation]
		  > Let $\vec{A}$ be parallel to $\vec{B}$ and let $c$ be any [[Scaler]].
		  > $$\large{\vec{A}=c*\vec{B}}$$
	- To solve for the intersection point of two [[Vector|Vectors]] convert them into their [[Parametric Function|Parametric Equations]] and set a variable 
- ## Intersection of Two Planes
	- Two planes intersect if they are not parallel.
		- Two planes are parallel if their [[Normal Vector|Normal Vectors]] are parallel. See equation above for parallel vectors.
