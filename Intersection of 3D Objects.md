- ## Intersection of Two Vectors
	- To check if two [[Vector|Vectors]] intersect you need to first check if the two [[Vector|Vectors]] are parallel. 
		- Two vectors are parallel if one is a multiple of the other.
		  > [!Equation]
		  > Let $\vec{A}$ be parallel to $\vec{B}$ and let $c$ be any [[Scaler]].
		  > $$\large{\vec{A}=c*\vec{B}}$$
	- To solve for the intersection point of two [[Vector|Vectors]] convert them into their [[Parametric Function|Parametric Equations]] and set them equal to each other.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > Let $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ be [[Vector|Vectors]] that are not parallel. Let $t$ be the parametric variable for each [[Vector]].
	  > $$\large{\vec{A}=\left\langle A_{x}(t), A_{y}(t),A_{z}(t) \right\rangle}$$
	  > $$\large{\vec{B}=\left\langle B_{x}(t), B_{y}(t),B_{z}(t) \right\rangle}$$

- ## Intersection of Two Planes
	- Two planes intersect if they are not parallel.
		- Two planes are parallel if their [[Normal Vector|Normal Vectors]] are parallel. See equation above for parallel vectors.
