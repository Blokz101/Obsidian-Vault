	- A set of points that a function assigns to the same value.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > A [[Level Surface]] of function $f(x,y,\dots)$ is made of all the points $(x,y,\dots)$ such that:
	  > $$\large{f(x,y,\dots)=C}$$
	  > Where $C$ is constant.
	  > > [!Example]
	  > > The picture below shows the level surface or set where $f(x,y)=-4$
