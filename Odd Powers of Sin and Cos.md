- ## Definition
	- In order to integrate $Sin$ or $Cos$ that are raised to a high **even** power we can use this this formula to expand them:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{Sin^{2n+1}(x)=(1-Cos^2(x))^n*Sin(x)}$$
	  > $$\large{Cos^{2n+1}(x)=(1-Sin^2(x))^n*Cos(x)}$$
	- This is simply the basic [[Pythagorean Identities]] rearranged:
	- > [!Equation]
		  > Some $Sin$ function where $n$ is **even**, therefore $2n+1$ is **odd**.
		  > $$Sin^{2n+1}(x)$$
		  > Split apart the exponent:
		  > $$=Sin^{2n}(x)*Sin^1(x)$$
		  >  $$=(Sin^2(x))^n*Sin(x)$$
		  >  Substitute with [[Pythagorean Identities]]:
		  >  $$=(1-Cos^2(x))^n*Sin(x)$$
		  >  The exact same process applies for $Cos(x)$.
