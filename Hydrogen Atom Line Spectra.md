- ## Experiment
	- A tube of hydrogen gas has an electrical charge passed through it and it emits a light. 
	- When this light passes though a prism it fractures into the [[Spectrum of Light]] however only a few lines of it. This is known as the [[Hydrogen Atom Line Spectra|Hydrogen Atom Line Spectra]].

- ## Explanation
	- The reason for the differing lines of light has to do with excited [[Electron|Electrons]] jumping between energy levels.
	- When the [[Electron]] gets excited it jumps from specific energy levels to other specific energy levels and releases [[Spectrum of Light|Light]] as it does so. Because of the specific levels it is jumping between it releases a different [[Frequency Of Light]] for each specific jump. This is why we only see some stripes of the [[Spectrum of Light]].
	  > [!What If?]
	  > If the [[Electron]] jumped to a random energy level every time, we would see the full [[Spectrum of Light]].
- ## Reference
	- Lead to the development of the [[Bohr's Model]] of the [[Atom]].
