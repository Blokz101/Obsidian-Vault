#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A bond between two [[Element|Elements]] where an [[Electron]] is **unevenly** shared.
		- This is because one [[Element]] has a higher [[Electronegativity]] then the other [[Element]], but **not enough to completely steal the [[Electron]]**. Therefore they **unevenly** share it.
	- This gives the more [[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] [[Element]] an [[Oxidation State]] of something between $-0$ and $-1$ and the less [[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] [[Element]] an [[Oxidation State]] of something between $+0$ and $+1$.
		- This can be represented with $+\delta$ or $-\delta$.
