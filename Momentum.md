- ## Definition
	- Symbol: $\vec{p}$
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{p}= \gamma * m\vec{v}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\gamma$ = [[Gamma Factor]]
	  > $m$ = [[Mass]]
	  > $\vec{v}$ = [[Velocity]]
	  > 
	  > For speeds less than 10% the [[Speed of Light]], the [[Gamma Factor]] is so small that it can be ignored.
	- Change in [[Momentum]] is not the same as the change in the [[Magnitude]] of [[Momentum]]
