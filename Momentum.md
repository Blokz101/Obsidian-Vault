- ## Definition
	- Symbol: $\vec{p}$
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{p}= \gamma * m\vec{v}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\gamma$ = [[Gamma Factor]]
	  > $m$ = [[Mass]]
	  > $\vec{v}$ = [[Velocity]]
	  > 
	  > For speeds less than 10% the [[Speed of Light]], the [[Gamma Factor]] is so small that it can be ignored.
	- **[[Magnitude]] of change in [[Momentum]]** is **not** the same as the **change in the [[Magnitude]] of [[Momentum]]**.
		- $\large{|\Delta \vec{p}| \neq \Delta|\vec{p}|}$
		- [[Magnitude]] does not have a direction and therefore will not be negative in most cases.
