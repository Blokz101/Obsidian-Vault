- ## Definition
	- Symbol: $\vec{p}$
	- > [!Equation]
	  >For speeds under 10% of the [[Speed of Light]] this equation is extremely accurate: 
	  > 
	  > $$\large{\vec{p}\approx m\vec{v}}$$
	  > 
	  > For speeds greater than 10% the [[Speed of Light]], the fact that [[Mass]] increases as [[Velocity]] approaches the [[Speed of Light]]:
	  > 
	  > $$\large{\vec{p}= \gamma * m\vec{v}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{p}$ = [[Momentum]]
	  > $\gamma$ = [[Gamma Factor]]
	  > $m$ = [[Mass]]
	  > $\vec{v}$ = [[Velocity]]
	- **[[Magnitude]] of change in [[Momentum]]** is **not** the same as the **Change in the [[Magnitude]] of [[Momentum]]**.
		- $\large{|\Delta \vec{p}| \neq \Delta|\vec{p}|}$
		- [[Magnitude]] does not have a direction and therefore will not be negative in most cases. 
			- **[[Magnitude]] of change in [[Momentum]]** will normally be positive.
			- **Change in the [[Magnitude]] of [[Momentum]]** will normally be negative.
