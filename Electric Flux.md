- ## Definition
	- How much of an [[Electric Field]] passes though a closed surface.
	- [[Electric Flux|Gauss's Law]] states:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\Phi=\large{\oint \vec{E}\cdot \hat{n}A \, dx}$$
		  > When the [[Electric Field]] is constant over the surface:
		  > $$\large{\Phi=\vec{E}\cdot \hat{n}A}$$
		  > $\Phi$ = [[Electric Flux]] over a closed surface in $Vm$
		  > $\vec{E}$ = [[Electric Field]] penetrating the surface in $\frac{N}{C}$ or $\frac{V}{m}$
		  > $\vec{n}$ = [[Normal Vector]] for the surface pointing outwards in $m$
		  > $A$ = Area of the surface in $m^2$
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\Phi=\frac{q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_{0}}}$$
		  > 
		  > $\Phi$ = [[Electric Flux]] over a closed surface in $Vm$
		  > $q_{\text{enclosed}}$ = Total surface [[Charge]] of the object in $C$
		  > $\epsilon_{0}$ = $8.85e-12\ \frac{C^2}{Nm^2}$
	- Flux is symbolized with $\Phi$.
