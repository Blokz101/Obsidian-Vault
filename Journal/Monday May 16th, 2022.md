###### Drew a dick on the white board in spanish
#Rant
I got about 4 hours of sleep today and honestly just wasnt feeling it today, however I made it to school, got a lot done in Psychology today and then went to Spanish. I got a lot of work done there too. At the end of the class Isac had a dry erase marker and was drawing a face on the white board when I felt the need to grab the marker and draw a dick on the board and then leave class early. Honestly I still dont know why exactly I did it, but I know that I did not mean it will mal intent towards profe and more as a joke or even a stupidly arrogant attempt to show off.

Long story short profe saw it and was very offended and I returned to her class and appologized. The thing in writing about is why did I do it, why did I feel the need to act out like that and why do I feel defiant rebellion in general in her class. Is it because of the repituation I have created for myself, that of a kid who does not care about his grades and acts like a class clown? And now maybe I feel forced to conform to it? Or was it more of a "fuck you" to the Spanish work that I had just finished, and it was more for me then anyone else. Sort of like throwing down a pencil after a long test.

Anyway you roll the dice I regret what I did, I know thats not me and I dont want to build that reputation for myself. I think its already a little too late for her class, but for the rest of the school year I think im am going to make an effort to be better in her class. 
In the end, that is not the kind of person I want to be or for people to see me as.


###### Chloe, Jeff, and a deviding rift
#Jeff #Chloe
I made an entry about Chloe last night but I just realized that there was something I did not address in that, I feel like on the road that we are currently on will lead to them breaking up and Chloe possibly pursuing me. I talked a little about my romantic feelings about Chloe yesterday, ill reference it here. 
![[Sunday May 15th, 2022#^9d0e22]]

I think what I said yesterday really stands, I dont think I would be able to get into an official relationship with her this soon provided that Jeff never started dating her. This is a large part of the reason that I am scared that they will break up. I dont want to throw away the relationship that I have with her right now to try to emulate something more. I also dont know if I would be able to do a relationship like this virtually and without physical contact of any type. It sort of is my love language...

The worry that I have is that Jeff is spending so little time with Chloe and seems to not care at all. This leaves her to depend on me for emotional support(not trying to make it seem like its not mutual, this just isnt about me atm). I worry that if Jeff pushes this too far then, lured by the prospect of a posiable relationship with me and pushed away by Jeff, she will break up with him and the serino I discribed above will occur.

I also wish that Jeff would pay more god damn attention and stop causing needless pain, theres that too, but thats a topic for another time.
