###### A lot of people are surprised when they find out that I am a senior
[[Rant]]
Ive been approached by several people, the most recent one today, whom are surprised to find out that I am a senior. Specifically today a random girl in Spanish class. I believed I knew how people perceived me and I was fine with it, but this has shaken that foundation honestly.

I know that I tend to have a larger ego and am more arrogant than what I should be, and I do want to change that, but I never thought it came off as childish. I know how I want to be seen and how I ~~think~~ thought I was seen, distant, cold, and uncaring about most things, and it bothers me that I might be so far in my perception vs reality. 

The thing that bothers is that I know that some of my behaviors mimmic those of autistic kids at my school but on a much lesser extent. For example, spontaneous outbursts in class, overreacting to things. The examples I mentioned, or at least the instances I observed came across as extremely childish and immature.

I fear that the slight mannerisms I have that mimmic the examples I gave come across as immature and unprecedented. I know that I'm likely over analyzing right now but the repeated occurrence has created an insecurity if I am honest. I dont mind being seen as many things, ranging from cold to foolish, but I really dont want to be viewed as immature. 

Back to what I was saying earlier, the thing that bothers me the most is the discrepancy between how I thought I was viewed and how I am viewed. Regardless of what I said above I dont apparently come across as a senior to a lot of people and that is a little surprising to me. I fear that I have let my ego strengthen my reality distortion field around me without me noticing to the point where this happens.

That scares me mainly for the reason that if what I fear is true, then I have a much larger ego than I assumed and it is interfering with my ability to objectively judge things. If that is true then I need to make some major adjustments to bring that back down. It's not who I want to be. Like I said above I want to be self confident but I dont want it to border into arrogance. 

As almost supporting evidence, a quote from Hamilton comes to mind:
> [!Quote ] Non-Stop
> Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Soon that attitude may be your doom!

I see a lot of myself reflected in this quote, I do have a tendency to be surprised when other people are smarter than I am, and I hate it. Not the other people part, the fact that I do have a reality distortion field great enough to cause me to believe that. Am I just too lazy to make the adjustments..?
