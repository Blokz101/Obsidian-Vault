## Progress
\[*04:44:12 pm*\] Starting research

\[*05:16:12 pm*\] Just finished creating the rig that will hold the motor. It's not pretty, composed of a ladder, 2x4 and some screws, but it will serve. I have three concerns:
- I need a way to control the direction of the motor and a way to turn it on or off. 
- I think I may need to reprint the motor winch part; It may need to be larger and I may need to create threads on it to guide the rope. 
- I need to find weights that can incrementally increase the force.

\[*05:33:12 pm*\] I dont think i'm going to rig a way to switch the motor on and off and instead just tap the wire together. I hope i'll be able to get the measurements even with both my hands occupied. I also think that I am going to use metal bars cut at specific lengths as weights. 

\[*05:46:17 pm*\] I just did an experiment where I tied an entire bar to the motor and applied 12v to the motor. It wound up the bar way too quickly and I remembered that the motor exerts a much greater stall current. I think I am going to have to use Mami's weights.

\[*05:57:40 pm*\] I just tied an 8lb weight to the winch and applied 12v. It lifted it easily and when it dropped a corner of the weight landed on the rope, cut it, and damaged the outer sheath of the weight. Whoops... I am going to redesign the winch to have a larger diameter, be longer and add something to keep the rope on the winch.

\[*06:11:53 pm*\] I am also realizing that these progress notes are longer than I intended and I will need a better format for these. Because of that I am going to forgo measuring the basic parameters and instead rework some of this system.

\[*07:19:48 pm*\] Just finished designing the new motor winch. It now has a lip to prevent the string from going off the side and a slight incline towards the end that the rope is attached to to hopefully keep the rope winding compact.
