###### Intro of Chloe to this journal
#Chloe
Well, this is probably going to be one of the few entries in this journal that are made in good spirit. A surprising turn of events in a lot of ways. Either way the topic is current that random girl I met on Valorant a month ago.

A little history first though for future orientation. I met Beetles in a Valorant game about a month or so ago (may be off by an entire month, no clue and I don’t think I’m going to bother checking, probably over a month though...) and shortly after she and Jeff got into a relationship. I was a little surprised by the speed of that one but honestly don’t think of much of it considering I’m not looking for a relationship. I was a tad annoyed but that was more because we were talking and I thought she could be a close friend, then they started dating and I didn’t wanna get in between anything.

Anyways, about two or three weeks ago she asked to call and we started calling a lot more often. I quickly found that I could talk to her about almost anything and not fear the threat of retribution with the info I gave her. It also helps that we share a lot in common and it really dosent take much to convey what I mean, even when its explained horribly. I have a tendency to do that but thats not of importance. Long story short we got really close really fast. Fun fact, she is the first person whom I expressed my view on women and dress code and shit to.

Shortly after that I remember that she was comfortable enough to sit with me in call even after all her meds wore off and she knew she could be persuaded into giving away info and possibly not remember it the next day. She shared a bit then and honestly that willingness surprised me. Looking back I think it was a major reason I was able to trust her so quickly. I place a lot of value in that kind of trust and show of vulnerability.

Some time after that she also had a little of a breakdown on call with me and same principle applies. I feel a little bad in placing value in something that horrible for another person however... Either way I still did my best to help so said guilt is slightly mitigated I think...

Anyways, we have been consistently calling every night and many times during the day. One of the great things is that she is ok with us both working on different things and that makes the entire friendship and time that we spend on call much more sustainable on my side. If it wasn’t for that I don’t think I would be able to devote even half the time to the calls that we have together as I can right now.

This brings us to the present. I just had the falling out with Jeff that I knew was coming for a long time and I wanted to journal about my feelings and walls and such in this situation. Currently I think I’ve dropped every wall besides those keeping me from falling for her and thats honestly amazing. Something I was not able to do with Delilah, wether for lack of time spent together or the lack of the understanding I feel with Chloe. 

I don’t think I have an overwhelming wish that we were in a relationship right now though I know that if things were different and her and Jeff never got into a relationship, theres a good chance we would be in a relationship right now. However,  this is where logic does intervene a little. The reason I would hesitate is because this is so new and I don’t like jumping into relationships based off of a short time of passion. Despite the amazing time so far there is not the reliability of time and that makes me hesitant. ^9d0e22

Same logic about time plays into the fact that I don’t know if it is a good idea to save the money to fly to see her. There is a lot more to my hesitance on that one though. Let me explain.

The walls I was talking about earlier, the ones keeping my romantic feelings from taking any sort of hold are a lot easier to maintain when there is geological distance in the way. I worry that if we meet in person and get even slightly physical (ex. She leans her head on me or especially if I somehow wind up scratching her head) then I will have a much harder time holding said walls. 

I will hold them but I fear that it may take the project resentment tactic that I use on so many others to hold said walls. I don’t want to have to do that because that would require rebuilding some other walls... I don’t know, in a lot of ways this almost seems like its too good to be true.

Oh, side note, it’s so fucking adorable that scratching her head is like a relaxation trigger for her. Let me explain why I find it so. First, having something like that and letting another know of its existence is a major show of trust and vulnerability in my book. Second , I cant stop picturing it going the same way as scratching a cats head would, I can’t explain it but I find the fact that she does have a little trigger like that adorable. Oh well, so much for that explaining bit.

Anyways I should get some sleep because its 1:28 am and I have school tomorrow.
