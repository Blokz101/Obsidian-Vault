- ## Definition
	- Notated with $S$.
	- Measured in $VA$.
	- Commonly in this form:
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{S=P+jQ}$$
	  > 
	  > $S$ = [[Complex Power]] in $VA$.
	  > $P$ = [[Real Power]] in $W$
	  > $Q$ = [[Reactive Power]] in $VAR$
	- Can be found by transforming [[Real Power]] to [[comp]]
