- ## Definition
	- The [[Force]] that changes [[Angular Momentum]] with respect to point $\vec{A}$.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{\tau}_{a}=\vec{r}_{a}\times \vec{F}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{\tau}_{a}$ = The [[Torque]] with respect to point $\vec{A}$ in $SOMETHING$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = [[Position]] from point $\vec{A}$ to where the [[Force]] is being applied in $m$
	  > $\vec{F}$ = [[Force]] being applied in $N$
