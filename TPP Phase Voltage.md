- ## Definition
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] refers to the [[Phasor]] [[Voltage]] across the entire **source**(voltage source and resistor) or **load**(just resistor). in a system that uses [[Three Phase Power]].
	- > [!Example]
	  > $\large{\tilde{V}_{an}}$ is the [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] produced by the [[Voltage Source]] on line $a$.
