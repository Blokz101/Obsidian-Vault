- ## Definition
	- This note uses [[Voltage]], but the same information applies to [[Current]].
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] refers to the [[Phasor]] [[Voltage]] across the entire **source**(voltage source and resistor) or **load**(just resistor). in a system that uses [[Three Phase Power]].
		- In easier terms, line to neutral [[Voltage]].
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] relations.
