- ## Definition
	- This note uses [[Voltage]], but the same information applies to [[Current]].
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] refers to the [[Phasor]] [[Voltage]] across the entire **source**(voltage source and resistor) or **load**(just resistor). in a system that uses [[Three Phase Power]].
		- In easier terms, line to neutral [[Voltage]].
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] relations.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}_{an}=\tilde{V}_{p}}$$
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}_{bn}=\tilde{V}_{p}\angle -120}$$
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}_{cn}=\tilde{V}_{p}\angle +120}$$
		  > 
		  > In this equation $\tilde{V_{}}$
	- > [!Example]
	  > $\large{\tilde{V}_{an}}$ is the [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] produced by the [[Voltage Source]] on line $a$.
