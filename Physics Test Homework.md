#### Problem 1
> A Ping-Pong ball is acted upon by the Earth, air resistance, and a strong wind. Here are the positions of the ball at several times. 
> Early time interval:
> 
> At $t = 12.51s$, the position was $\left\langle 5.77, 2.38, -8.49 \right\rangle$m.
> At $t = 12.51s$, the position was $\left\langle 5.77, 2.38, -8.49 \right\rangle$m.
> 
> Late time interval:
> 
> At $t = 12.51s$, the position was $\left\langle 5.77, 2.38, -8.49 \right\rangle$m.
> At $t = 12.51s$, the position was $\left\langle 5.77, 2.38, -8.49 \right\rangle$m.
