- ## Definition
	- The [[Charge (Chemistry)]] that reflects the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] an [[Element]] must gain or lose to bond with another [[Atom]].
	- In general a main group [[Element|Element's]] [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] will range from: **the group of the [[Element]] to the group of the [[Element]] minus 8**.
		- > [!Example]-
		> $Cl$ is in group $7A$:
		> 
		> Therefore its [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] can range from:
		> $7$ to $-1$
- In general a transition [[Element|Element's]] [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] will be $2+$.
	- Due to a loss of two [[Electron|Electrons]] in its $s$ [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Sublevel]].
- ## The Oxidation Rules
	- #### Rule 1 (The Elemental Rule)
		- The [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of atoms in their **Elemental Form** is $0$.
			- Example: $Fe$, $S_8$, $O_2$
	- #### Rule 2 (The Fluorine Rule)
		- $F$ or Fluorine is always assigned an [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of $-1$ due to its high [[Electronegativity|Electronegativity]].
			- Except if **Rule 1 applies**.
	- #### Rule 3 (The Group Rule)
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of **Group 1A** is always $+1$.
			- > [!Warning]
			> This excludes Hydrogen because of the Hydrogen Rule.
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of **Group 2A** is always $+2$.
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of **$Al$** is always $+3$.
	- #### Rule 4 (The Hydrogen Rule)
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of $H$ or **Hydrogen** is:
			- $+1$ if bonded to a [[Non-Metal]].
			- $-1$ if bonded to  [[Metal]].
			- $0$ if bonded to another **Hydrogen** atom.
	- #### Rule 5 (The Oxygen Rule)
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of $O$ or **Oxygen** is $-2$.
	- #### Rule 6 (The Halogens Rule)
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of all [[Halogens]] is $-1$.
- ## Determining the Oxidation Number from a [[Lewis Dot Structure]]
	- The more [[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] [[Element]] gets possession of both [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]] and the charge is calculated accordingly.
	- Very similar to [[Formal Charge]], but the [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]] are split equally between the two [[Atom|Atoms]].l
