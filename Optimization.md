- ## Definition
	- A method for finding the max or min of some function.
- ## Single Variable [[Optimization]]
	- Steps:
		- Find [[Critical Point (Calculus)|Critical Points]] of the function equal to $0$.
		- Use the [[Second Derivative Test]] to check if the [[Critical Point (Calculus)|Critical Point]] is a **max** or **min**.
- ## Multi-Variable [[Optimization]]
	- Steps:
		- Set each [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] of the function equal to $0$.
		- Solve the set of equations for points that satisfy both [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] being equal to $0$.
		- Calculate the value for each point to determine the **max** and **mins** or use the [[Second Derivative Test]].
