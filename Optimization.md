	- A method for finding the max or min of some function.
- ## Single Variable [[Optimization]]
	- Steps:
		- Find [[Critical Point (Calculus)|Critical Points]] of the function equal to $0$.
		- Use the [[Second Derivative Test]] to check if the [[Critical Point (Calculus)|Critical Point]] is a **max** or **min**.
- ## Multi-Variable [[Optimization]]
	- Steps:
		- Set each [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] of the function equal to $0$.
		- Solve for a list of points where the [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]]
