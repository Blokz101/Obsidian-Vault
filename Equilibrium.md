#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- When the rate of the [[Rate of Reaction|Forwards Rate of Reaction]] equals the [[Rate of Reaction|Reverse Rate of Reaction]] and the **reaction** stops.
		- $R_f=R_r$
		- $\Delta G=0$
	- As a **reaction** continues it approaches [[Equilibrium]]. ^969ddc
		- [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **reactants** drops and the [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **products** rise. 
		- The forwards [[Rate of Reaction]] and the reverse [[Rate of Reaction]] increase or decrease respectively until they equal one another.
		- ![[IMG_80F9867E5D91-1.jpeg|400]]
			- Reactant is formed at the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] while 
			- In this example the [[Rate of Reaction|Reverse Rate of Reaction]] (in red) sped up from **0** to **3** and the [[Rate of Reaction|Forwards Rate of Reaction]] (in blue) got slowed down from **8** to **3**. When the two equal each other they are at [[Equilibrium]].
	- When a reaction reaches [[Equilibrium]] the amount of **reactants** and **products** do not have to equal each other.
		- If the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] is higher then the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] then there will be a larger amount of **product** than **reactant** at [[Equilibrium]].
		- If the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] is higher then the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]] then there will be a larger amount of **reactant** than **product** at [[Equilibrium]].
- ## [[Equilibrium]] Constant
	- The [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]] is:
	- > [!Equation]
          > $$K=\frac{k_f}{k_r}$$
          > 
          > $K$ = [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]].
          > $k_f$ = [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]].
          > $k_r$ = [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
- ## Writing Equilibrium Expressions
	- A way to solve for $K$ at [[Equilibrium]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$K=\frac{k_f}{k_r}=\frac{[products]^{coeff}}{[reactants]^{coeff}}$$
	  > 
	  > $K$ = [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]].
	  > $reactants$ = [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **reactant** in [[Molarity|mpL]].
	  > $products$ =  [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **product** in [[Molarity|mpL]].
	  > $coeff$ = The **coefficient** of the respective **reactant** or **product**.
	  > 
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > The $[reactants]^{coeff}$ or $[products]^{coeff}$ refers to a list of each of the **reactants** or **products** [[Molarity|Concentrations]] to the power of their **coefficient**.

	  > > Must represent each [[States Of Matter|State of Matter]] in the following way:
	  > > - Aqueous Solute [[Molarity|Concentration]] (aq) = $\frac{mol}{L}$.
	  > > - Pure [[Solid]] [[Molarity|Concentration]] (s) = $1$.
	  > > - Pure [[Liquid]] [[Molarity|Concentration]] (l) = $1$.
	  > > - Pure [[Gas]] [[Molarity|Concentration]] (g) = $\frac{mol}{L}$.
