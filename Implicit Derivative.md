- ## Definition
	- The [[Derivative]] of an [[Implicit Function]].
	- To take the [[Derivative]] of an [[Implicit Function]]:
		- Begin taking the [[Derivative]] like normal.
		- When you need to take the [[Derivative]] of $f(x)$ write it as $\frac{df}{dx}$.
		- After [[Derivative|Differentiation]] solve for $\frac{df}{dx}$, this will probably be in terms of $f(x)$.
		- Optional: Solve the original equation for $f(x)$ and plug it into the [[Implicit Derivative]] that was just calculated.
- ## [[Implicit Derivative]] of a [[Multi-Variable Function]]
	- Use something similar to the basic method of [[Implicit Derivative|Implicit Differentiation]]:
		- > [!Note]
		  > There are two important types of variable types for this method:
		  > - Variable
		  > - Functions of the variable
		- When taking the [[Partial Derivative]] of the **Variable**, do so as normal.
		- When taking the 
	- If another method of [[Implicit Derivative|Implicit Differentiation]] is required then use this equation:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > Let $F(x,y)$ be the function we want to [[Derivative|Differentiate]], it must be solved for $0$.
	  > Let $y=f(x)$.
	  > 
	  > $$\large{\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{F_{x}}{F_{y}}}$$

- ## Practice

- ## Reference
	- Same as [[Derivative|Differentiation]] but works with $f(x)$ in on both sides.
