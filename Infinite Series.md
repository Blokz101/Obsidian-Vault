- ## Definition
	- The [[Summation Notation|Sum]] of an infinite [[Sequence]] is called an [[Infinite Series]].
- ## Determining Convergence Or Divergence
	- Determining if a [[Sequence]] **converges** or **diverges** tells us a lot about the sequence, including if we can find the overall sum of the [[Sequence]].
	- There are several minor and major theorems that can help us determine this.
	- > [!Theorem]
	  > Let $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ be two [[Sequence|Sequences]]. If:
	  > $$\large{a_{n}=b_{n+k}}$$
	  > Then:
	  > $$\large{\lim_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}}$$
- ## Determining The Sum
	- If the [[Infinite Series]] **converges**, then it approaches some sum. We can find that sum for some [[Infinite Series]] like this:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_{n}=\lim_{ n \to \infty }\sum^{n}_{i=1}a_{i}}$
