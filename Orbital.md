#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A volume of space where where an [[Electron]] is most likely located.
		- "Places" in a [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Sublevel]] that [[Electron|Electrons]] can reside.
	- Only two [[Electron|Electrons]] are allowed per [[Orbital]].
		- When there are two they are referred to as paired.
		- They must be [[Spin Quantum Number|Spinning]] in opposite directions to be paired.
		- Often represented as single boxes in diagrams.
- ## Reference
	- The number of [[Orbital|Orbitals]] in a [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Sublevel]] is defined by the [[Magnetic Orbital Quantum Number]].
