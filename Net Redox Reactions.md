	- > [!Example]-
	  > Write the net equation for the reaction (if there is one) when hydrogen gas is bubbled into a nickel(II) iodide solution.
	  > 
	  > > [!Prep]
	  > > Write our our equation:
	  > > 
	  > > $H_2(g)+NiI_2(aq)\rightarrow?$
	  > > 
	  > > $NiI_2$ is [[Solubility|Soluble]] so  the species are present in [[Ion|Ions]] so we have to rewrite our equation and account for different **reactants** in the [[Standard Reduction Potentials Table]].
	  > > 
	  > > $H_2(g)+Ni^{+2}(aq)+2I^-(aq)\rightarrow?$
	  >

	  > > Look up our **reactants** on the [[Standard Reduction Potentials Table]] and list them:

	  > > 
	  > > **There is no reaction** because the only vacant orbital is higher in energy than both the  filled orbitals.
