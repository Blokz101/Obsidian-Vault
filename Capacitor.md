- ## Definition
	- A [[Electrical Component|Passive Component]] that can store and release [[Charge]].

		  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
		  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$

		  > $d$ = Distance as shown in the drawing below in $m$
	- A [[Capacitor]] has 4 important states. Let some event happen at $t=0$. This could be a switch closing or an
