- ## Definition
	- A [[Electrical Component|Passive Component]] that can store and release [[Charge]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{Q=CV}$$
		  > $$\large{C=\epsilon \frac{A}{d}}$$
		  > 
		  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
		  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$
		  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] in $V$
		  > $A$ = Area of plates in the drawing below in $m^2$
		  > $d$ = Distance as shown in the drawing below in $m$
	- Key properties for [[Circuit Analysis]]:
		- The [[Voltage]] over a [[Capacitor]] **cannot** change instantly.
		- The [[Current]] though a [[Capacitor]] **can** change instantly.
		- When in [[Steady State]] [[Current]]
	- A [[Capacitor]] has 4 important states. These states occur when some event occurs, we will say it occurs at $t=0$, that takes the [[Capacitor]] out of [[Steady State]].
		- **$t=0^-$**
			- This is the time the instant before the event occurs.
			- The capacitor is in [[Steady State]].
			- $i(0^-)=0$
