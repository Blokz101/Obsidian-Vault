- ## Definition
	- ![[Pasted image 20240220145653.png|300]]
	- A [[Electrical Component|Passive Component]] that can store and release [[Charge]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{Q=CV}$$
		  > 
		  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
		  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$
		  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] in $V$
	- Key properties for [[Circuit Analysis]]:
		- The [[Voltage]] over a [[Capacitor]] **cannot** change instantly.
			- $v(0^-)=v(0^+)$
		- When in [[Steady State]] the [[Current]] though a [[Capacitor]] is $0$.
		- [[Impedance]]
		  ![[Impedance#^901ff2]]
	- A [[Capacitor]] has 4 important states. These states occur when some event occurs, we will say it occurs at $t=0$, that takes the [[Capacitor]] out of [[Steady State]].
		- **$t=0^-$**
			- This is the time the instant before the event occurs.
			- The capacitor is in [[Steady State]].
			- $i(0^-)=0$
		- **$t=0^+$**
			- This is the time the instant after the event occurs.
			- $v(0^-)=v(0^+)$
		- **$0<t<\infty$**
			- This is the time period after the event occurs but before [[Steady State]] is reached again.
			- The [[Current]] through the [[Capacitor]] is:
			  > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{i=C \frac{dV}{dt}}$$
			  > 
			  > $i$ = [[Current]] though the [[Capacitor]] in $A$
			  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] though the [[Capacitor]] in $V$
			  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$
			  > $t$ = Time in $s$
			- The [[Voltage]] across the [[capacitor]] can be found by solving the [[Differential Equation]] given above.
			  > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{v(t)=[v(0^+)-v(\infty)]*e^{-t/\tau}+v(\infty)}$$
			  > 
			  > $v(t)$ = [[Voltage]] over the [[Capacitor]] in $V$
			  > $v(0^+)$, $v(0^-)$, $v(\infty)$ = [[Voltage]] across the [[Capacitor]] at states described in this list in $V$
			  > $\tau$ = Time constant in $\Omega C$
			  > $t$ = Time in $s$
			  
			  > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{\tau=RC}$$
			  > 
			  > $\tau$ = TIme constant in $\Omega C$
			  > $R$ = [[Resistance]] across the [[Capacitor]] in $\Omega$
			  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$
			  > 
			  > > [!Note]
			  > > The [[Resistance]] can be found by solving for the [[Thevenin Equivalent Circuit]] or [[Norton Equivalent Circuit]] around the [[Capacitor]] and using the [[Resistance]] value there.
		- **$t=\infty$**
			- This is the time period when the [[Capacitor]] reaches [[Steady State]] again after the event.
			- $i(0^-)=0$
	- Made up of two metal plates and an [[Insulator]] in between.

	- A [[Capacitor]] is not a linear component, its [[Current]], [[Voltage]], and [[Resistance]] change depending time since the [[Capacitor]] was connected or disconnected from a power source.

- ## How It Works
	- A [[Capacitor]] is actually an [[Open Circuit]], but still allows [[Current]] to flow in a round about way.
		- The two metal plates of the [[Capacitor]] have [[Electron|Electrons]] in them. 
		- When connected to a power source [[Electron|Electrons]] are pushed into one plate.
		- That plate gains a net negative [[Charge]] and repels [[Electron|Electrons]] out of the opposite plate. 
		- This mimics [[Current]] flow and when this is happening the [[Capacitor]] is charging.
		- ![[IMG_1E61DE55C4B6-1.jpeg]]
	- When fully charged there is a massive [[Electron]] build up on one plate and a lack of [[Electron|Electrons]] on the opposite plate stops [[Current]] from flowing.
		- At this point the force of the [[Electric Field]] generated by the difference in [[Charge]] between the two plates is great enough to equal the [[Voltage|Potential Difference]] from the energy source. Therefore no more [[Current]] flows.

- ## [[Electric Field]] In A [[Capacitor]]
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{|\vec{E}|\approx \frac{Q}{A\epsilon_{0}}}$$
	  > $|\vec{E}|$ [[Electric Field]] in the [[Capacitor]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $Q$ = The [[Charge]] on each plate in $C$
	  > $A$ = The area of each plate in $m^2$
