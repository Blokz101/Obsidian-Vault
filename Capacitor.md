- ## Definition
	- A [[Electrical Component|Passive Component]] that can store up and release [[Charge]].
	- Made up of two metal plates and an [[Insulator]] in between.

	- A [[Capacitor]] is actually an [[Open Circuit]], but still allows [[Current]] to flow in a round about way.
		- The two metal plates of the [[Capacitor]] have [[Electron|Electrons]] in them. 
		- When connected to a power source [[Electron|Electrons]] are pushed into one plate.
		- That plate gains a net negative [[Charge]] and repels [[Electron|Electrons]] out of the opposite plate. 
		- This mimics [[Current]] flow and when this is happening the [[Capacitor]] is charging.
