- ## Definition
	- A [[Electrical Component|Passive Component]] that can store and release [[Charge]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{Q=CV}$$
		  > $\large{C=\epsilon \frac{A}{d}}$
		  > 
		  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
		  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $F$
		  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] in $V$
		  > $A$ = Area of plates in the drawing below in $m^2$
		  > $d$ = Distance as shown in the drawing below in $m$
	- Made up of two metal plates and an [[Insulator]] in between.

	- A [[Capacitor]] is not a linear component, its [[Current]], [[Voltage]], and [[Resistance]] change depending on how much [[Charge]] it has stored. Generally these quantities change with time as the [[Capacitor]] is charging or discharging.

		  > $$\large{i_{c}=C\frac{dv_{c}}{dt}}$$
		  > 
		  > $i_{c}$ = [[Current]] through the [[Capacitor]] in $A$
		  > $v_{c}$ = [[Voltage]] over the [[Capacitor]] in $V$
		  > $t$ = Time in $s$
- ## How they work
	- A [[Capacitor]] is actually an [[Open Circuit]], but still allows [[Current]] to flow in a round about way.
		- The two metal plates of the [[Capacitor]] have [[Electron|Electrons]] in them. 
		- When connected to a power source [[Electron|Electrons]] are pushed into one plate.
		- That plate gains a net negative [[Charge]] and repels [[Electron|Electrons]] out of the opposite plate. 
		- This mimics [[Current]] flow and when this is happening the [[Capacitor]] is charging.

	- When fully charged there is a massive [[Electron]] build up on one plate and a lack of [[Electron|Electrons]] on the opposite plate stops [[Current]] from flowing.
		- At this point the force of the [[Electric Field]] generated by the difference in [[Charge]] between the two plates is great enough to equal the [[Voltage|Potential Difference]] from the energy source. Therefore no more [[Current]] flows.
