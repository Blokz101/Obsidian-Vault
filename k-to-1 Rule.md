- ## Definition
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite [[Set|Sets]]. The function $f:X \to Y$ is a [[Counting Bijection Rule|k-to-1 Correspondence]] if for every $y \in Y$ there is exactly $k$ different $x \in X$ such that $f(x)=y$.

	- > A group of kids at a slumber party all leave their shoes in a big pile at the door. One way to count the number of kids at the party is to count the number of shoes and divide by $2$. Of course, it is important to establish that each kid has exactly one pair of shoes in the pile. Counting kids by counting shoes and dividing by $2$ is an example of the k-to-1 rule with $k=2$. Applying the k-to-1 rule requires a well defined function from objects we can count to objects we would like to count. In the example with the shoes, the function maps each shoe to the kid who owns it.
