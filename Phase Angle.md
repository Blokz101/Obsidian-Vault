- ## Definition
	- An angle that gets added to a [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)]] that basically acts as a horizontal offset for the cosine function.
	- A [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)]] with a phase of $\frac{2}{\pi}$ is the same as a **Sine Wave**.
	- From [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)]]>
