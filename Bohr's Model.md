- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-09-03 19.15.45.excalidraw|400]]
	- The same as the [[Rutherford's Model]] but with **6** defined **energy levels** that the [[Electron|Electrons]] must orbit on. 
	- Significant because it showed that [[Electron|Electrons]] move in quantized[^1] [[Energy (Chemistry)]] transitions.
- ## Interactions
	- [[Electron|Electrons]] can jump between energy levels via the process of [[Absorption and Emission]].
	- Each energy levels has a measurable [[Energy (Chemistry)]] given by this equation. ^925e1e

		   > $E_{level}$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] (J)
		   > $Z$ = [[Atomic Number]]
		   > $R$ = [[Rydberg's Constant]] = $3.29e15$ ($s^{-1}$)
		   > $h$ = [[Planck's Constant]] = $6.626e-34$ ($Js$)
		   > $n$ = Energy Level (integer)

		- The [[Energy (Chemistry)]] is negative because [[Energy (Chemistry)]] decreases as a [[Proton]] and [[Electron]] approach one another. This is proven by [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].
- ## Bohr Radius
	- If we relate the concept of quantized energy levels above to [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]] we can determine the radius of each of the energy levels.

- ## Experiment
	- [[Hydrogen Atom Line Spectra]]
- ## Reference
	- A current model of the [[Atom]].
	  > [!Warning]
	  > This model only holds true for the [[Element]] Hydrogen and other [[Ion|Ions]] that have only one [[Electron]].
