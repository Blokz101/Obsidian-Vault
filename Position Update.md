- ## Definition
	- If the [[Velocity]] is mostly constant then we can use the [[Average Velocity]] to predict the objects position in the future.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{r}_{f}=\vec{r}_{i}+(\vec{v}_{avg}*\Delta t)}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{r}_{f}$ = Initial Position [[Vector]]
	  > $\vec{r}_{i}$ = Final Position [[Vector]]
	  > $\Delta t$ = Change in [[Time]]
	  > 
	  > This is simply the [[Average Velocity]] equation thats rearranged and $v_{avg}$ ^2eb7a6
