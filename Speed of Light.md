- ## Definition
	- > [!Speed of Light]
	  >$$\large{3.0e8m/s}$$
	  
	  The speed at witch light travels.
- ## Equation
	- This equation relates the [[Speed of Light]] to [[Wavelength]] and [[Frequency]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$S=\lambda*v$$
	  > 
	  > $S$ = [[Speed of Light]] (Meters/Second) = $3.0e8m/s$
	  > $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]] (Meters)
	  > $v$ = [[Frequency]] ([[Hertz]])
- ## Reference
	- Is a **constant**, however is related to [[Frequency]] and [[Energy]]
