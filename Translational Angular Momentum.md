- ## Definition
	- The [[Angular Momentum]] of an object with respect to some point $\vec{A}$.
		- Example: If your looking at an object being throw you must rotate your head to track it. This is the [[Translational Angular Momentum]]. It also means that if the object is being thrown straight at you, you dont have to move your head, and therefore the object has no [[Translational Angular Momentum]] with respect to your position.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{L}_{trans, A}=\vec{r}_{A}\times \vec{p}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{L}_{trans}$ = [[Translational Angular Momentum]] in $kg \frac{m^{2}}{s}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position vector from $\vec{A}$ to the object in $m$
	  > $\vec{p}$ = [[Momentum]] of the object in $kg\frac{m}{s}$
	  > 
	  > The $\times$ symbol stands for the [[Vector Cross Product]].
