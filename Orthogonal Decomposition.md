- ## Definition
	- A method of breaking down a complex single [[Vector]] into multiple more simple [[Vector|Vectors]].
	  > [!Example]
	  > $\large{<3,2,1>}$
	  > can be decomposed into
	  > $\large{<3,0,0>+<0,2,0>+<0,0,1>}$
	  > with a reference to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axis
	- To decompose [[Vector|Vectors]] with respect to other [[Vector|Vectors]] that are not on the standard axis, [[Orthogonal Projection]] can be used:
