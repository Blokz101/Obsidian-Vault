- ## Definition
	- Using the [[The Momentum Principle]] and [[Hooke's Law (Physics)]] we can determine the [[Hooke's Law (Physics)|Spring Stiffness (Physics)]] of springs in both **series** and **parallel**.
	- As a reference point, we need to find the [[Hooke's Law (Physics)|Spring Constant (Physics)]] of a single **spring** being stretched by some force.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > For simplicity, we will assume a setup with a spring hanging from the ceiling with a weight attached to it. The weight is not moving.
		  > 
		  > The [[The Momentum Principle]] states:
		  > $\Delta \vec{p}=\vec{F}_{net}\Delta t$
		  > The weight is at rest so we know that there is no change in [[Momentum]]
		  > $$\begin{align}
		0 & = \vec{F}_{net}
		> \end{align}$$
