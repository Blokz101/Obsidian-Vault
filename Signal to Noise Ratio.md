- ## Definition
	- The ratio of the desired [[Periodic Signal]] to [[Noise]] in a reading.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{SNR=10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}} \right)}$$
	  > 
	  > $SNR$ = [[Signal to Noise Ratio]] in $dB$
	  > $P_{\text{signal}}$ = [[Power]] of desired signal in $W$
	  > $P_{\text{noise}}$ = [[Power]] of noise in $W$
