#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A type of [[Electrochemical Cell]] where [[Electron|Electrons]] transfer [[Spontaneity|Spontaneously]] though an external circuit.
	- ![[IMG_34EA197AEA1F-1.jpeg]]
- ## Cell Potential Energy 
	- The [[Energy]] released can be calculated by this:
		- Number of [[Electron|Electrons]]
		- "Weight" of those [[Electron|Electrons]]
		- [[Voltage]] difference
	- > [!Energy]
	  > $$\Delta G = -n*F*E_{cell}$$
	  > 
	  > $\Delta G$ = [[Free Energy]] in [[Energy|J]]
	  > $n$ = Amount of [[Electron]] transferred in the [[Oxidation and Reduction Reaction|Redox Reaction]] in [[Mole|Moles]]
	  > $F$ = [[Faraday's Constant]] in [[Coulomb's Law of Energy|C]]/[[Mole|Moles]]
	  > $E_{cell}$ = The potential energy of the cell: $E_{cathode}-E_{anode}$ in [[Energy|J]]/[[Coulomb's Law of Energy|C]]
