- ## Definition
	- A convention for notating [[Electrical Component|Passive Components]] in an [[Electrical Circuit]].
		- Resistors
		- Capacitors
		- Inductors
		- Etc...
	- This convention allows for calculations with [[Ohm's Law]].
	- States that [[Current]] flows from the point of greater [[Voltage]] to the point of lesser [[Voltage]]. Therefore [[Voltage Polarity]] and [[Current]] Direction **must be opposite each other**.
