- ## Definition
	- A loop with [[Current]] running though it [[Magnetic Field]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{B_{loop}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{2\pi R^2I}{(z^2+R^2)^{3/2}}}$$
	  > 
	  > $B_{loop}$ = [[Magnetic Field of a Loop]] in $T$
	  > $R$ = Radius of loop in $m$
	  > $I$ = [[Conventional Current]] in $A$
	  > $\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}$ = $1e-7 \frac{Tm^2}{C \frac{m}{s}}$
	  > $z$ = Distance from center of loop to observation point in $m$
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > The observation point must be on the axis that goes though the ring and is perpendicular to it.
