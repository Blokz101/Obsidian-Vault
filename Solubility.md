#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- How much of a [[Solute]] can **dissolve** into a [[Solvent]].
	- [[Solubility]] can be determined by the [[Solubility Rules]]. The [[Solubility Rules]] are based on the following principles:
		- [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]]
			- The **higher the charges** are the **stronger** the [[Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Force]] and therefore the less [[Solubility|Insoluble]].
			- The **lower the charges** are the **weaker** the [[Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Force]] and therefore the less [[Solubility|Soluble]].
		- The [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]] of an equation.
			- An [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]] of **1 or above** is considered to be **high** and [[Solubility|Soluble]].
			- An [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant]] of **below 1** is considered to be **low** and [[Solubility|Insoluble]].

		- [[Polarity|Polar]] sections of a [[Molecule]] can interact with [[Intramolecular Forces|Intramolecular Force]] with other [[Polarity|Polar]] sections. The same applies for [[Polarity|Non-Polar]] to [[Polarity|Non-Polar]].
			- For bonds to form the [[Polarity]] of the any sections of the molecule must be the same.

			- The size of the [[Polarity]] regions matters as well.

					- The **lower** the [[Molarity]] the **less** the two are able to **interact and dissolve**.
