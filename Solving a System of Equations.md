- ## Definition
	- When given a [[System of Equations]] there are thee cases:
		1. A Unique Solution (System is consistent)
			- When each variable can be set to a value such that all equations are true for the specific combination of values, and false for all other combinations.
		2. Many Solutions (Under defined)
			- When there are more unknown variables then equations.
			- This can also happen if there are an equal number of equations as unknown variables, but one of the equations ends with a constant being equal to itself.
		3. No Solution (Inconsistent)
			- If there is some error in solving. Such as a constant being equal to a different constant, or divide by 0 errors.
