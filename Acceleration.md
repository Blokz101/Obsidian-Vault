- ## Definition
	- The [[Acceleration]] at an instant in [[Time]].
		- Can be found when $\Delta t$ of [[Average Acceleration]] approaches 0.
		- This is the same as the [[Derivative]] of $\vec{v}$([[Velocity]]) in respect to [[Time]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{a}_{\text{instant}}=\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}=\left\langle \frac{dv_{x}}{dt},\frac{dv_{y}}{dt},\frac{dv_{z}}{dt} \right\rangle}$$
	- [[Acceleration]] can also be found from the [[Net Force]] and [[Mass]].
