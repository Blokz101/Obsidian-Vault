- ## Definition
	- ![[IMG_A7867ED36E5A-1.jpeg]]
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\tilde{I}_{AB}=\frac{\tilde{V}_{AB}}{Z_{\Delta}}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\tilde{I}_{AB}$ = [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Current]] from node $A$ to $B$ in $A$
	  > $\tilde{V}_{AB}$ = [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] from node $A$ to $B$ in $V$
	  > $Z_{\Delta}$ = [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Currents]] can be obtained from [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Currents]].
