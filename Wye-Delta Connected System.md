	  > $\tilde{I}_{AB}$ = [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Current]] at load from node $A$ to $B$ in $A$
	  > $\tilde{V}_{AB}$ = [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] at load from node $A$ to $B$ in $V$
	  > $Z_{\Delta}$ = [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Currents]] can be obtained from [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Currents]].
