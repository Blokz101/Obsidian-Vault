- ## Definition
	- A [[Binomial Distribution]] random variable $X$ is the number of successes in a fixed number of trails.
	- Requirements:
		- Experiment consists of a sequence of $n$ smaller experiments called *trials*, where $n$ is fixed before any trials take place.
		- Each trial must result in either a *success* or *failure*.
		- The trials are independent.
		- The probability of success, $p$, is constant between trials.
