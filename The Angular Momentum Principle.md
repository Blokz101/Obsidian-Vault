- ## Definition
	- The change in [[Angular Momentum]] is equal to the [[Torque]] acting on the [[System]] multiplied by the [[Time]] interval during which the change took place.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\Delta \vec{L}_{A}=\vec{\tau}_{net,A}\Delta t}$$
	  > 
	  > $\Delta \vec{L}_{A}$ = Total [[Angular Momentum]] in $kg \frac{m^2}{s}$
	  > $\vec{\tau}_{net,A}$ = [[Torque]] in $SOMETHING$
	  > $\Delta t$ = Change in time in $s$
