- ## Definition
	- When the [[Net Force]] is constant we can use [[Momentum Update]] and [[Position Update]] to predict motion by running this calculation over and over and over again.
	- > [!Warning]
	  > This equation requires dozens of iterations to be even semi accurate even with a constant [[Net Force]].
	  > 
	  > The much better version of this is [[Analytic Prediction Of Motion]].
- ## Steps
	- #### Calculate The Net Force
		- Use info from the problem to find the [[Net Force]] acting on the object.
	- #### Find Final Momentum
		- Use [[Momentum Update]] to update find the final [[Momentum]] of the object.
		- ![[Momentum Update#^dcf00a]]
	- #### Update Position
		- Use the new [[Momentum]] to update the [[Position]] of the object.
		- ![[Position Update#^8f2a5a]]
