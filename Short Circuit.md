- ## Definition
	- When the two ends of a [[Voltage Source]] or [[Current Source]] are connected with little to no [[Resistance]].
	- [[Resistance]] is very low, [[Current]] is very high, [[Voltage]] is 0 because there is no [[Voltage|Potential Difference]].
	- This will almost always burn something out before long.
