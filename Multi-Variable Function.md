- ## Definition
	- A function that assigns a point of many variables to a single value.
		- A Two-Variable Function is one that assigns each point $(x,y)$ to a single value.
			- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{f(x,y)}$$
			- This function can be represented in three dimensions by letting the function $f=z$.
			  
		- A Three-Variable Function is one that assigns each point $(x,y,z)$ to a single value.
			- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{f(x,y,z)}$$
	- [[Calculus|Calculus I]] and [[Calculus II]] delt exclusively with single variable [[Function|Single-Variable Functions]].
	- [[Calculus III]] works with [[Multi-Variable Function]].
