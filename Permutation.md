- ## Definition
	- An $r$ [[Permutation]] is a [[Sequence]] of $r$ items without repetition.
	- To [[Counting|Count]] a [[Permutation]] use this equation:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P{(n,r)}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}$$
	  > 
	  > $P(r,n)$ = The number of [[Permutation|Permutations]] possible
	  > $n$ = Number of elements in parent [[Set]]
	  > $r$ = Length of each [[Permutation]]
	  > 
	  > $P(r,n)$ is the number of $r$ [[Permutation|Permutations]] from a [[Set]] with $n$ elements.
