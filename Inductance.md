- ## Definition
	- How much an [[Inductor]] resists the change of [[Current]] flowing though it.

		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{L=\frac{N^2\mu A}{L}}$$
		  > 
		  > $L$ = [[Inductance]] in $H$
		  > $\mu$ = Permeability of the core in $?$
		  > $A$ = Cross sectional Area in $m^2$
		  > $L$ = Length of core in $m$
		  > $N$ = Number of coils
	- Measured in [[Henry]].
	- Notated with $L$
