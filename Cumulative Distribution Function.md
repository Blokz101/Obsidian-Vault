- ## Definition
	- Very similar to the [[Discrete Random Variable Distribution|Probability Mass Function]] but gives values for the probability that the observed value of $X$ will be at most $x$.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{F(x) = P(X\leq x)=\sum^{}_{y:y\leq x}p(y)}$$
		  > 
		  > $F(x)$ = [[Cumulative Distribution Function]]
