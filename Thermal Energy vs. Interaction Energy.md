#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- [[Interaction Energy]] remains relatively the same compared to [[Thermal Energy (Chemistry)]]. Therefor:
		- A [[Solid]] at 0c has greater [[Interaction Energy]] then [[Thermal Energy (Chemistry)]].
		- A [[Liquid]] at 25c has about the same [[Interaction Energy]] as [[Thermal Energy (Chemistry)]].
		- A [[Gas]] at 150c has greater [[Thermal Energy (Chemistry)]] then [[Interaction Energy]].
