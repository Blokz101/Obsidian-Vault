#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and the path it takes to get there.
	- [[Reaction Rate Constants]] is the rate at which the reaction will occur. It is broken into the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] and the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
		- The [[Reaction Rate Constants]] are determined by the energy difference between the **reactants** and **products**.
	- ![[IMG_E6B087F931F7-1.jpeg]]
		- Reactants are lower in energy then 
	- When transferring from **reactants** to **products** the reaction will be in a [[Transition State]] for a **fleeting moment**.
		- The [[Transition State]] is higher in energy then the **reactants** or **products** and therefore all reactions require an [[Activation Energy]].

- ## Reference
	- [[Thermodynamics]] describes the initial and final [[Energy]] of a reaction while [[Kinetics]] describes the path taken to get from the initial to final [[Energy]].
