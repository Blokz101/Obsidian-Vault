#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and the path it takes to get there.
	- When transferring from reactants to products the reaction will be in a [[Transition State]] for a fleeting moment.
		- The [[Transition State]] is higher in energy then the **reactants** or **products**.

- ## Reference
	- [[Thermodynamics]] describes the initial and final [[Energy]] of a reaction while [[Kinetics]] describes the path taken to get from the initial to final [[Energy]].
