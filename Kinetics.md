#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and the path it takes to get there.
	- When transferring from **reactants** to **products** the reaction will be in a [[Transition State]] for a **fleeting moment**.
		- The [[Transition State]] is higher in energy then the **reactants** or **products** and therefore all reactions require an [[Activation Energy]].
		- ![[IMG_7238256BDDDF-1 1.jpeg|200]]
	- The difference in energy between the reactants, products, and [[Transition State]] determine how fast the reaction will take place.
		- The reaction sp
- ## Reference
	- [[Thermodynamics]] describes the initial and final [[Energy]] of a reaction while [[Kinetics]] describes the path taken to get from the initial to final [[Energy]].
