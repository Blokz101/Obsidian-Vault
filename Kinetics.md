#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and the path it takes to get there.
	- [[Reaction Rate Constants]] is the rate at which the reaction will occur.
		- ![[Reaction Rate Constants#^f97fea]]
	- ![[IMG_E6B087F931F7-1.jpeg]]
	- For the diagram above:
		- **Reactants** are lower in [[Energy]] then **products**.
			- Forwards [[Activation Energy]] is **higher**  then reverse [[Activation Energy]].
			- [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] is **lower** then the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
		- **Products** are lower in [[Energy]] then **reactants**.
			- Forwards [[Activation Energy]] is **lower**  then reverse [[Activation Energy]].
			- [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] is **higher** then the [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
		- **Reactants** and **products** are at the same [[Energy]].
			- Forwards [[Activation Energy]] is **equal**  to reverse [[Activation Energy]].
			- [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]] is **equal** to [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
	- When transferring from **reactants** to **products** the reaction will be in a [[Transition State]] for a **fleeting moment**.
		- The [[Transition State]] is higher in energy then the **reactants** or **products** and therefore all reactions require an [[Activation Energy]].

- ## Reference
	- [[Thermodynamics]] describes the initial and final [[Energy]] of a reaction while [[Kinetics]] describes the path taken to get from the initial to final [[Energy]].
