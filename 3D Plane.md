- ## Definition
	- A flat surface that extends into infinity.
	- There are many options to define a [[3D Plane]] and these are the most useful:
		- [[Normal Vector]] and [[Point]]

		>  $$\large{A(x-x_{0})+B(y-y_{0})+C(z-z_{0})=0}$$
		>  $$\text{or}$$
		>  $$\large{Ax+By+Cz=Ax_{0}+By_{0}+Cz_{0}}$$
		  > 
		  > $(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ = [[Point]] the [[3D Plane]] pases though.
		  > $\left\langle A,B,C \right\rangle$ = [[Normal Vector]] to the [[3D Plane]]
		  
- ## Conversions
	- From 3 [[Point|Points]] to [[Point]] and [[Normal Vector]]:
