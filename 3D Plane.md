- ## Definition
	- A flat surface that extends into infinity.
	- There are many options to define a [[3D Plane]] and the [[Normal Vector]] and [[Point]] method is generally the most useful.

	- Conversions to and from this format vary, but most of them include trying to find two [[Vector|Vectors]] in the [[3D Plane]] and then using the [[Vector Cross Product]] to find a [[Normal Vector]].
