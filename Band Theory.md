#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- States that [[Solid|Solids]] are [[Insulator|Insulators]], [[Semi Conductor|Semi Conductors]], or [[Conductor|Conductors]] based on the gap between [[Orbital|Orbitals]] according to [[Molecular Orbital Theory]].
	- ![[IMG_F9D024D9195C-1.jpeg|400]]
	- The large the gap between [[Orbital|Orbitals]] the more [[Energy]] it takes for [[Electron|Electrons]] to be able to jump [[Orbital|Orbitals]] into an excited state.

	  Almost no gap so electrons can easily move between orbitals.|Small gap, so electrons can sometimes move between orbitals.|Large gap, so it is very hard for electrons to move between orbitals.
- ## Parts of the Band
	- Conduction Band
		- The upper section of the band in blue where the empt[[Orbital|Orbitals]] are.
	- Fermi Level
		- Same as the [[LUMO]], the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.
	- Valence Band
		- The lower section of the band in red where the filled [[Orbital|Orbitals]] are.
