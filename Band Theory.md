#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- States that [[Solid|Solids]] are [[Insulator|Insulators]], [[Semi Conductor|Semi Conductors]], or [[Conductor|Conductors]] based on the gap between [[Orbital|Orbitals]] according to [[Molecular Orbital Theory]].
	- ![[IMG_F9D024D9195C-1.jpeg|400]]
	- The large the gap between [[Orbital|Orbitals]] the more [[Energy]] it takes for [[Electron|Electrons]] to be able to jump [[Orbital|Orbitals]] into an excited state.
	- [[Conductor]]|[[Semi Conductor]]|[[Insulator]]
