- ## Definition
	- States that moving [[Charge|Charges]] or [[Current]] generates a [[Magnetic Field]] around a wire.
		- This only works for a **short thin wire** as it is an approximation of sorts.

	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
	  > $\Delta \vec{l}$ = Position vector from start to end of the wire in the direction of [[Conventional Current]] in $m$

	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position from [[Charge]] to observation point in $m$
