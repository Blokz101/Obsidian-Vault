- ## Definition
	- Newer method of representing [[Signed Integer|Signed Integers]], works like an Odometer in an old car.
		- If you roll the number back past 0, it flips to its lar
	- The first bit is still the [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]].
	- How to represent **Positive** and **Negative** [[Two's Complement]] Integers
		- **Positive** [[Integer|Integers]] are represented the same way as [[Unsigned Integer|Unsigned Integers]] are.
		- To convert an [[Unsigned Integer]] to a **negative** [[Two's Complement]] integer:
			- Flip every bit (Take the [[One's Complement]] or [[Negate]] it)
			- Add 1

- ## Reference
	- [[One's Complement]] is in [[Two's Complement]] used to [[Negate]] [[Bit|Bits]]
