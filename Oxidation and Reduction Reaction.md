#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A reaction in which the [[Oxidation State|Oxidation States]] of the [[Atom|Atoms]] change. This is done because when reacting, the [[Atom|Atoms]] give away/take [[Electron|Electrons]] from the other [[Atom|Atoms]] they are reacting with.
	- There are two types of agents in [[Oxidation and Reduction Reaction|Oxidation and Reduction Reactions]].
		- [[Reducing Agent]]
			-  ![[Reducing Agent#^bfee04]]
		- [[Oxidizing Agent]]
			-  ![[Oxidizing Agent#^1a1948]]
