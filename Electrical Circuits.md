		- In the figure there is:
			- **Electromotive** force $E$ in volts (V)
			- **Resistance** $R$ in ohms (Ω)
			- **Inductor** $L$ in henrys (H)
			- **Capacitor** $C$ in farads (F) in series. 
		- $R$, $L$ and $C$ are constants. The voltage $E$ could be a constant battery or an oscillating house voltage.
	- $Q$ is the **charge** in the **capacitor** at some time $t$. 
	- $I$ is the **current** and the [[Derivative]] of **charge**.
	- There is a **voltage** drop across each component when the circuit is closed. The drops are:
		- Component|Drop
		  ---|---
		  Inductor|$L \frac{dI}{dt}$
		  Resistor|$RI$
		  Capacitor|$\frac{Q}{C}$
