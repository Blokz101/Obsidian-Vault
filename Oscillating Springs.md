- ## Definition
	- Normal springs have some some kind of [[Friction Force]] acting on them. To account for this we can add a [[Damping Force]] with some **damping constant** $c$, that always opposes motion.
		- The faster the spring is compressing and releasing, the more force the [[Damping Force]] applies. Just like [[Friction Force|Friction]].
