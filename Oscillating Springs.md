- ## Definition
	- Normal springs have some some kind of [[Friction Force]] acting on them. To account for this we can add a [[Damping Force]] with some **damping constant** $c$, that always opposes motion.
		- The faster the spring is compressing and releasing, the more force the [[Damping Force]] applies. Just like [[Friction Force|Friction]].

	  > > The [[Net Force]] acting on the mass that is on the end of the spring can be given by the sum of the [[Hooke's Law (Calculus II)|Spring Force]] and the [[Damping Force]]
