	- A spectrum of the wave lengths that **Electromagnetic Radiation or Light**, can have. The [[Wavelength|Wavelengths]] change the property of the light.
- ## Spectrum
	- **Longest [[Wavelength]] and [[Frequency Of Light]]**
		- **Radio waves**: [[Wavelength|Wavelengths]] are about as long as football fields. Used for communication.
		- **Microwaves**: Are efficiently absorbed by water and converted to heat. Used to cook and warm things up.
		- **Infrared**: Heat
		- **Visible Light**: [[Visible Light]]
