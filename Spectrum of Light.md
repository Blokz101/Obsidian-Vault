#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A spectrum of the wave lengths that **Electromagnetic Radiation or Light**, can have. The [[Wavelength|Wavelengths]] change the property of the light.
- ## Spectrum
	- **Longest [[Wavelength]] and [[Frequency]]**
	- Radio waves: [[Wavelength|Wavelengths]] are about as long as football fields. Used for communication.
	- Microwaves: Are efficiently absorbed by water and converted to heat. Used to cook and warm things up.
	- Infrared: Heat
	- Visible Light
	- **Shortest [[Wavelength]] and [[Frequency]]**
