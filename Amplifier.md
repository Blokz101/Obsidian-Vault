- ## Definition
	- An [[Electrical Component]] that takes an input [[Voltage]] and scales it by some [[Gain]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V_{out}(t) = A_{v}V_{in}(t)}$$
	  > 
	  > $V_{out}(t)$ = Output [[Voltage]] as a function of time in $V$
	  > $V_{in}(t)$ = Input [[Voltage]] as a function of time in $V$
	  > $A_{v}$ = [[Gain]] in $dB$
