- ## Definition
	- The rate at witch [[Work (Physics)]] is done
	  > [!Equation] 
	  > $$P=\frac{dW}{dt}$$
	  > or
	  > $$\large{P=VI}$$
	  > (See proof below)
	  > 
	  > $P$ = [[Power]] in $W$
	  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] in $J$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $V$ = [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
