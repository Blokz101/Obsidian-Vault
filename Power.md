- ## Definition
	- The rate at witch [[Work (Physics)]] is done.
	  > [!Equation] 
	  > $$P(t)=\frac{dW}{dt}$$
	  > or
	  > $$\large{P(t)=V(t)I(t)}$$
	  > (See proof below)
	  > 
	  > $P(t)$ = Instantaneous [[Power]] as a function of time in $W$
	  > $W$ = [[Work (Physics)]] in $J$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $V(t)$ = [[Voltage]] as a function of time in $V$
	  > $I(t)$ = [[Current]] as a function of time in $A$
	  > 
	  > > [!Warning]
	  > > Because [[Power]] goes by the definition of [[Work (Physics)]], it uses **electron current** instead of [[Conventional Current]] like the rest of [[Circuit Analysis]].
	  > > 
	  > > To get around this, when solving for [[Power]] in [[Circuit Analysis]] simply define [[Current]] though **energy sources** as going into the **positive terminal** and out of the **negative terminal.**

	- Power can also be calculated
