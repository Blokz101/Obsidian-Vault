- ## Definition
	- A type of average of [[Instantaneous Power]].
	- Also known as [[Power|Real Power]].
	- Measured in [[Watts]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P_{avg}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T} P(t) \, dt}$$
	  > 
	  > $P_{avg}$ = [[Power]] in $W$
	  > $P(t)$ = [[Instantaneous Power]] as a function of time in $W$
	  > $T$ = [[Period]] in $s$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	- At a [[Resistor]] the [[Power]] can also be calculated like this:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P=V_{rms}*I_{rms}}$$
	  > 
	  > $P$ = [[Power]] in $W$
	  > $V_{rms}$ = [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $I_{rms}$ = [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] [[Current]] in $A$
