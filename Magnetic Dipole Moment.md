- ## Definition
	- A measure of the separation of between the **north** and **south** poles of a magnet or magnet like dipole.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\mu=IA}$$
	  > 
	  > $\mu$ = [[Magnetic Dipole Moment]] in $Am^2$
	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
	  > $A$ = Area inside the loop in $m^2$
	  > 
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > If there is more then one coil then multiply the [[Magnetic Dipole Moment]] of a single coil and the number of coils.

	  > 
	  > $B_{axis}$ = [[Magnetic Field]] along the axis of the coil in $T$
	  > $r$ = Distance to observation point from the center of the coil in $m$
