- ## Definition
	- A method of transporting [[Real Power|Power]] using **three** wires. The [[Voltage|Voltages]] and [[Current|Currents]] of each wire are out of [[Phase Angle|Phase]] with each other by $120$.

	- The **source** of [[Three Phase Power]] is equivalent to three [[Voltage]] sources connected to three different lines in either a [[Delta Configuration]] or [[Wye Configuration]].
