- ## Definition
	- A method of transporting [[Real Power|Power]] using **three** wires. The [[Voltage|Voltages]] and [[Current|Currents]] of each wire are out of [[Phase Angle|Phase]] with each other by $120$.

		- In the [[Complex Domain]] the [[Complex Power|Complex Powers]] would look like this:

		  > $$\large{V_{an}=V_{p}\angle 0\degree}$$
		  > $$\large{V_{bn}=V_{p}\angle 120\degree}$$
		  > $$\large{V_{cn}=V_{p}\angle -120\degree}$$
	- The [[Delta Configuration]] / [[Wye Configuration]] for both **source** and **load** can be mix and matched. This creates $4$ possible combinations:
		- [[Delta-Delta Connected System]]
		- [[Delta-Wye Connected System]]
		- [[Wye-Delta Connected System]]
		- [[Wye-Wye Connected System]]
- #### Source
	- The **source** of [[Three Phase Power]] is equivalent to three [[Voltage]] sources connected in either a [[Delta Configuration]] or [[Wye Configuration]].

		- Note that the magnitude of all the [[Voltage Source|Voltage Sources]] are equals.
- #### Load
	- The **load** of [[Three Phase Power]] is equivalent to three [[Resistor|Resistors]] connected in either a [[Delta Configuration]] or [[Wye Configuration]].
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-23 at 4.14.36 PM.png]]
		- Not that the magnitudes of all the [[Resistor|Resistors]] are equal.
