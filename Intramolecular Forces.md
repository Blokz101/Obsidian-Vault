#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The forces between [[Molecule|Molecules]].
	- Based on the [[Dipole (Chemistry)]] and [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].
- ## Types of [[Intramolecular Forces]]
	- [[Dispersion Forces]]
		- ![[Dispersion Forces#^4d6b40]]
	- [[Dipole Forces]]
		- ![[Dipole Forces#^02f383]]
	- [[Hydrogen Bonding]]
		- ![[Hydrogen Bonding#^f5ad4a]]
- ## Practice
	- [[Drawing 2022-10-15 17.28.17.excalidraw]]
- ## Reference
	- Different  from [[Intermolecular Forces]] which are the forces between atoms in a [[Molecule]].
	- [[Intramolecular Forces]] play a large role in determining the [[Boiling and Melting Point]] of an [[Element]].
