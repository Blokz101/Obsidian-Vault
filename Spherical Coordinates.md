	  > [!Equation]
	  > Main Conversions:
	  > $$\large{x=\rho}$$
	  > $$\large{y=}$$
	  > $$\large{z=}$$
	  > 
	  > Other Conversions:
	  > $$\large{x^2+y^2=r^2}$$
	  > 
	  > Correction Term
	  > *When substituting using the equations above into an [[Integral]] multiply the new function by the correction term*
