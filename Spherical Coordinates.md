	- Conversions from [[Cartesian Coordinates]] to [[Spherical Coordinates]]:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > Main Conversions:
	  > $$\large{x=\rho \sin(\phi)\cos(\theta)}$$
	  > $$\large{y=\rho \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)}$$
	  > $$\large{z=\rho\cos(\phi)}$$
	  > 
	  > Correction Term
	  > *When substituting using the equations above into an [[Integral]] multiply the new function by the correction term*
	  > 
	  > $$\large{\rho^2\sin(\phi)}$$
