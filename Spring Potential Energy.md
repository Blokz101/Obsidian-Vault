- ## Definition
	- The [[Potential Energy]] of a spring given its displacement.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\Delta U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}ks^2}$$
	  > 
	  > $\Delta U_{S}$ = [[Spring Potential Energy]] in $J$
	  > $k$ = [[Hooke's Law (Physics)|Spring Constant (Physics)]]
	  > $s$ = Displacement in $m$
