- ## Definition
	- The ability to do [[Work (Chemistry)]].
- ## [[Spectrum of Light]]
	- This equation relates [[Energy (Chemistry)]] to [[Frequency Of Light]].
	  ![[Planck's Equation#^0cca3d]]
- ## [[Effective Nuclear Charge]]
	- This equation relates [[Energy (Chemistry)]] to [[Electronegativity]] and [[Principle Quantum Number]].
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$E=-\frac{Z_{eff}^2}{n^2}$$
	  > 
	  > $E$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] (Units Unknown)
	  > $n$ = [[Principle Quantum Number]] ([[Integer]])
	  > $Z_{eff}$ = [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] (Units Unknown)
	  
	  - Trend listed in [[Effective Nuclear Charge#^eb9b1e]].
- ## Units
	- [[Energy (Chemistry)]] is measured in the Calorie and the Joule.
	- $1cal=4.184J$
- ## Energy Changes
	- Energy changes in [[Process|Processes]], there are two types:
		- [[Endothermic Process]]
		  ![[Endothermic Process#^938bc5]]
		- [[Exothermic Process]] 
		  ![[Exothermic Process#^a1df59]]
