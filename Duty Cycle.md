- ## Definition
	- Percentage of the time that the wave is high.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $\large{DC=\frac{t_{V_{H}}}{T}}$
	  > 
	  > $DC$ = [[Duty Cycle]] in percentage
	  > $t_{V_{H}}$ = Time that the [[Voltage]] is high in $s$
	  > $T$ = [[Period]] in $s$
	- Only [[Periodic Signal|Waves]] with a distinct **high** and **low** state can have [[Duty Cycle|Duty Cycles]].
