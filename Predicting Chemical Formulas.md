- ## Steps
  > [!Warning]
  > This only works for [[Chemical Formulas]] that only have two [[Element|Elements]] in them. ^dbfa44
	1. Find the [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] for each [[Element]] you know in the [[Molecule]].
	2. The [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of each [[Element]] is the number of the other [[Element]] that are in the [[Molecule]].
	3. Simplify the subscripts if needed.

- ## Steps for a Diagram
	1. Find the [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] range for each "Element"
		1. The number of [[Electron|Electrons]] in the valence [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Subshell]] is the **Smallest** [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]].
		2. The number of [[Electron|Electrons]] **minus 8** for each "Element" [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Subshell]] is the **Largest** [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]].
	2. The "Element" that should use its **Largest** [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] is the one with the **highest** [[Electronegativity]].
	   > [!Explanation]-
	   > This is because [[Electronegativity]] and [[Ionization Energy]] go hand in hand. The "Element" with the lowest [[Ionization Energy]] will be most willing to give up its [[Electron|Electrons]] and the "Element" with the highest [[Electronegativity]] is pulling on the other's [[Electron|Electrons]] the hardest.
	3. You can then use the [[Predicting Chemical Formulas#^dbfa44|Steps]] listed above.
