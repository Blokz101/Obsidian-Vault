- ## Definition
	- We can use the [[Exponential Growth and Decay|Exponential Growth]] model to model [[Compound Interest]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{A(t)=P\left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}}$$
		  > 
		  > $A$ = Amount of money at time $t$
		  > $P$ = Initial amount of money
		  > $r$ = Interest rate
		  > $n$ = Number of times the interest is compounded per year
	- As the interest is compounded more and more often it approaches **Continuously Compounded Interest**.
