#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Notated as $\Delta H$
	- The change in **heat** at a **constant** [[Pressure]].
		- Ex. Water changing phases from a [[Liquid]] to a [[Gas]] would have positive [[Enthalpy]] because [[Energy]] is released during the process.
	- > [!Equation]
	> $$\Delta E_{system}=\Delta H+w$$
	> 
	> $\Delta E_{system}$ = [[Energy]] of the system
	> $\Delta H$ = [[Enthalpy]]
	> $w$ = [[Work]]
	
- ## Standard [[Enthalpy]]
- ## [[Enthalpy]] of [[Com]]
