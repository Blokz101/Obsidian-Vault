#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^9bcf2a
	- Notated as $R_f$ or $R_r$
	- The [[Rate of Reaction]]  is the speed that the **reactants** or **products** reach the [[Transition State]].
		- ![[IMG_40FC488C196B-1.jpeg|300]]
		- [[Molarity|Concentration]] is the chance that the right [[Molecule|Molecules]] will **collide**.
		- [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reaction Rate Constant]] is the chance that the [[Molecule|Molecules]] will collide in the **right orientation**.
	- The [[Rate of Reaction]] can be sped up by:
		-  Increasing the amount of **reactants** or **products**.
		- 
		- Adding a [[Catalyst]].

	  > $R_f$ = [[Reaction Rate Constants|Forwards Rate Constant]].
	  > $R_f$ = [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reverse Rate Constant]].
	  > $coeff$ = The **coefficient** of the respective **reactant** or **product**.
