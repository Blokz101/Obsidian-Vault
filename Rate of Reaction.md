#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Notated as $R_f$ or $R_r$
	- The [[Reaction Rate Constants]] can be determined by the **speed** at which the **reactants** or **products** reach the [[Transition State]]. ^f97fea
		- ![[IMG_40FC488C196B-1.jpeg|300]]
		- [[Molarity|Concentration]] increases the chance that the right [[Molecule|Molecules]] will **collide**.
		- A **rate constant** (related to the amount of [[Activation Energy]] required to start the reaction) determines how often they right [[Molecule|Molecules]] will collide in the **right orientation**.
