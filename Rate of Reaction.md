#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^9bcf2a
	- Notated as $R_f$ or $R_r$.
		-  $R_f$ is the [[Rate of Reaction]] in the forwards direction.
		- $R_r$ is the [[Rate of Reaction]] in the reverse direction.
	- The [[Rate of Reaction]]  is the speed that the **reactants** or **products** reach the [[Transition State]]..
		- ![[IMG_40FC488C196B-1.jpeg|300]]
		- [[Molarity|Concentration]] is the chance that the right [[Molecule|Molecules]] will **collide**.
		- [[Reaction Rate Constants|Reaction Rate Constant]] is the chance that the [[Molecule|Molecules]] will collide in the **right orientation**.
	- As a reaction continues it approaches [[Equilibrium]].
		- [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **reactants** drops and the [[Molarity|Concentration]] of **products** rise. 
		- The forwards [[Rate of Reaction]] and the reverse [[Rate of Reaction]] increase or decrease respectively until they equal one another.
	- The [[Rate of Reaction]] can be sped up by:
		-  Increasing the amount of **reactant**.
		- Removing excess **product**. 
		- Adding a [[Catalyst]].
