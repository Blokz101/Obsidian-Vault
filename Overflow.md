	- Signs of [[Overflow]]:
		- If the **[[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bits]] of the two numbers are the same AND different then the [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]] of the result**.
			- In other words you cant add two positive numbers and get an answer with a negative [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]], or add two negative numbers and get an answer with a positive [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]].
		- If the **carry in [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]] is not equal to the carry out [[Most Significant Bit|Sign Bit]]**.
			- Easiest for hardware to detect and so this method is used by actual computers.
