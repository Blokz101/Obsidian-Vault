- ## Definition
	- > In general, each outcome of an experiment can be associated with a number by specifying a rule of association (e.g., the number among the sample of ten components that fail to last 1000 hours or the total weight of baggage for a sample of 25 air-line passengers). Such a rule of association is called a random variableâ€”a variable because different numerical values are possible and random because the observed value depends on which of the possible experimental outcomes results.
	- Usually represented with $X$
