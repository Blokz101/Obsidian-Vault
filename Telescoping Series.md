- ## Definition
	- An [[Infinite Series]] in which the partial sums of the [[Sequence]] cancel out to simplify the sum.
		- Example:

	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}(b_{n}-b_{n+1})}$$
	- We can determine **convergence** with this simple rule:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > If this limit exists and is equal to some constant $L$:
	  > $$\large{\lim_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=L}$$
	  > Then the sum can be found with:
	  > $$\large{S=b_{1}-L}$$
