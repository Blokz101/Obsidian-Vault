#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The weakest of the three types of [[Intramolecular Forces]] and **can only occur in Non [[Polarity|Polar]] Molecules**.
	- [[Electron|Electrons]] move almost randomly in their orbit, this can result in instants when there are more [[Electron|Electrons]] towards one side of the [[Molecule]] then the other, and result in a **temporary** [[Dipole]].
	- The negative side of the [[Dipole]] pulls electrons in other [[Molecule|Molecules]] around it to one side and causes that molecule to have a **temporary** [[Dipole]] as well. Same for the positive end and repelling.

	- **Greatest effect in larger [[Molecule|Molecules]]** because of their greater [[Electron]] cloud.
