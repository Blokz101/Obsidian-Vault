- ## Definition
	- A measure of the separation of positive and negative [[Charge|Charges]] within a system or a measure of the system's overall polarity.

	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	  > $s$ = Distance in $m$
	- When a [[Dipole]] is placed in an [[Electric Field]] its [[Electric Dipole Moment]] can be found with:

	  > $p$ = [[Electric Dipole Moment]] in $???$
	  > $\alpha$ = [[Polarizability]] in $????$
	  > $E$ = [[Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
