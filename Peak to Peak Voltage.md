- ## Definition
	- The [[Voltage]] difference between the two peaks of the [[Periodic Signal|Wave]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V_{pp} = V_{H}-V_{L}}$$
	  > 
	  > $V_{pp}$ [[Peak to Peak Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{H}$ = Maximum [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{L}$ = Maximum [[Voltage]] in $V$
	- Also [[Amplitude]] multiplied by $2$.
