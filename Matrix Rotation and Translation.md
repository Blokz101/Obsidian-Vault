- ## Definition
	- Consider a point on a two dimensional plane with coordinates $(x,y)$. Let this point be represented by this [[Matrix]]:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$P=\begin{bmatrix}
		  > x\\
		  > y
		  > \end{bmatrix}$$
- #### Rotation
	- Let $\theta$ be the angle that the point will be rotated by. Note that the point will always be rotated around the origin with this method.
	- To achieve this rotation multiply the [[Matrix]] $P$ by $\Theta$ defined below.
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\Theta=\begin{bmatrix}
		  > \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\
		  > \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
		  > \end{bmatrix}$$
