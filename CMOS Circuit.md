- ## Definition
	- Stands for **Complementary [[Transistor|MOS]] Circuit**.
	- Circus that use both [[Transistor|N-Type]] and [[Transistor|P-Type]] [[Transistor|Transistors]] to create logic gates.
	- [[Transistor|P-Type]] are generally attached to power.
		- Pulls the output UP when the input is 0.
	- [[Transistor|N-Type]] are generally attached to ground.
		- Pulls the output DOWN when the input is 1.
	- > [!Warning]
	  > The **output** must always be connected to either **power** or **ground**. Never both, but also never neither.
