- ## Definition
	- If there is a [[Function (Discrete Math)|Bijection]] from one [[Set]] to another [[Set]] then the two sets have the same [[Cardinality]].
	  > Some sets are easier to count than others. One way to approach a difficult counting problem is to show that the cardinality of the set to be counted is equal to the cardinality of a set that is easy to count.
