- ## Definition
	- If there is a [[Function (Discrete Math)|Bijection]] from one [[Set]] to another [[Set]] then the two sets have the same [[Cardinality]].
	  > Some sets are easier to count than others. One way to approach a difficult counting problem is to show that the cardinality of the set to be counted is equal to the cardinality of a set that is easy to count.

- #### k-to-1 Rule
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite [[Set|Sets]]. The function $f:X \to Y$
	- > A group of kids at a slumber party all leave their shoes in a big pile at the door. One way to count the number of kids at the party is to count the number of shoes and divide by $2$. Of course, it is important to establish that each kid has exactly one pair of shoes in the pile. Counting kids by counting shoes and dividing by $2$ is an example of the k-to-1 rule with $k=2$. Applying the k-to-1 rule requires a well defined function from objects we can count to objects we would like to count. In the example with the shoes, the function maps each shoe to the kid who owns it.
