#Permanent [[Computer Systems]]

- ## Definition
	- Very old method of representing [[Signed Integer|Signed Integers]], rarely used anymore
	- Set the first bit to $1$ represent if the number is **negative**.
		- > [!Example]
		  > $5=0101$ and $-5=1101$
	- The main issue with this system is that there were two ways of representing $0$. There could be $+0$ or $-0$.
	- This system was abandoned for [[Two's Complement]] which is widely used today.
