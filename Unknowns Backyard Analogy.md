- ## Definition
	- States that we can find the number of unknown [[Current|Currents]] or [[Voltage|Voltages]] in an [[Electrical Circuit]] by looking at the number of **Backyards** and Voltage or Current Sources.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > When solving doing [[Branch Current Circuit Analysis]]:
	  > $$\large{\text{Unknown Currents}=\text{\# Backyards}-\text{\# Current Sources}}$$
	- A **Backyard** is any area in an [[Electrical Circuit]] that is fenced in by wires or [[Electrical Component|Components]].
