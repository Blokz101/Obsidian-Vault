- ## Definition
	- A definite [[Integral]] where the bounds of the inner [[Integral|Integrals]] may be functions of the variables of the outer [[Integral|Integrals]].
		- Normally these bounds are used to describe a shape that bounds a function of interest.

	- [[Iterated Integral|Iterated Integrals]] can be rewritten with a different order of integration to make some [[Iterated Integral|Iterated Integrals]] easier to solve.
	- [[Iterated Integral|Iterated Integrals]] can also be performed in [[Polar and Cylindrical Coordinates]] along with [[Spherical Coordinates]].
