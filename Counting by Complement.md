- ## Definition
	- Often times when trying to count some elements in a [[Set]] $A$ it is easier to count the number of things that are **not** in $A$ and then subtract form the [[Sample Space]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\bar{A}=\Omega-A}$$
	  > 
	  > $A$ = [[Set]] of elements we want to count
	  > $\bar{A}$ = [[Set]] of elements not in $\Omega$
	  > $\Omega$ = [[Sample Space]]
