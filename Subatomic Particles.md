- ## Definition
	- They make up [[Atom|Atoms]]. The number of [[Subatomic Particles]] in each atom defines its characteristics and properties. 
	- There are three [[Subatomic Particles]] of interest:
		
		| Particle | Symbol | Mass                | Charge | Location                         |
		| -------- | ------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
		| [[Proton]]   | $p^+$  | $1.0078amu$            | $+1$    | Inside the [[Nucleus]]    |
		| [[Neutron]] | $n^0$  | $1.0087amu$            | $0$      | Inside the [[Nucleus]]    |
		| [[Electron]] | $e^-$  | $0.0005amu$ | $-1$    | Outside the [[Nucleus]] |
		
- ## Interaction
	- [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]] dictates how [[Subatomic Particles]] interact with each other.
