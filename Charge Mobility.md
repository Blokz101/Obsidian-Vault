- ## Definition
	- How easily a [[Charge]] can move in a mate
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{v}_{avg}=u\vec{E}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{v}_{avg}$ = [[Average Velocity]] of a charge in an [[Electric Field]] $\vec{E}$ in $\frac{m}{s}$
	  > $u$ = [[Charge Mobility|Charge Mobility Constant]] in $\frac{m}{s}/\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $\vec{E}$ = External [[Electric Field]] acting on the [[Charge]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
