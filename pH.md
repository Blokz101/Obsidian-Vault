- ## Definition
	- The hydrogen [[Ion]] concentration in an [[Aqueous Solution]].
	- The negative [[Logarithm|log]] of the [[Molarity|Molar]] concentration of the hydrogen [[Ion]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$pH=-log(H^+)$$
	  > $pH$ = The pH of the [[Solution]]
	  > $H^+$ = The [[Molarity]] of hydrogen [[Ion|Ions]] in $\frac{mol}{L}$
