- ## Definition
	- States the the sum of the voltages on a closed loop will always equal 0.
		> [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\sum^{N}_{n=1}V_{n}=0}$$
		  > $N$ = Number of [[Component|Components]] in the chosen [[Loop]]
		  > $n$ = Index of [[Component]] in the chosen [[Loop]]
		  > $V_{n}$ = [[Voltage]] of [[Component]] at index $n$
	- In other words, voltage in will always equal voltage out.
	- > [!Example]

	  > $$\large{v_{1}=v_{2}+v_{3}+v_{4}}$$
- #### First Sign Convention
	- Used in [[Circuit Analysis]]
	- Pick a starting point in a [[Loop]], **the first [[Component]] has negative [[Voltage]]** and all other [[Component|Components]] have positive [[Voltage]].
