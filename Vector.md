- ## Definition
	- A [[Vector]] is a line segment  between two [[Point|Points]]. 
	- A [[Vector]] has two main critical aspects: 
		- [[Magnitude]] (Distance from $P$ to $Q$) and
		-  [[Direction]]: (from initial [[Point]] $P$ to final [[Point]] $Q$)
	- [[Vector|Vectors]] are the same if their [[Magnitude]] and [[Direction]] are the same.
	- Symbol: $\large{\vec{v}}$
	- ![[Drawing 2023-01-13 17.27.05.excalidraw]]
	- They are described by: $\large{\vec{v}}=\left\langle r_x,r_y,r_z \right\rangle$
	- These values can be calculated from a [[Vector]]:
		- [[Position]]
		- [[Angular Direction]]
		- [[Displacement]]
		- [[Magnitude]]
	- #### Conversion From Angles
