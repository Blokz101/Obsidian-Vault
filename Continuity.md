- ## Definition
	-  A [[Function]] is a [[Continuity|Continuous]] for its [[Domain]] if it can be sketched without the need to left your pencil.
	- If the [[Limit|Right Hand Limit]], [[Limit|Left Hand Limit]], and function itself are defined at an $x$ then the function is continuous at that $x$.
	- If the function is one of the following
	  
	  Function|Equation
	  ---|---
	  Polynomial|$ax^3+bx+c$
	  Rational|$\frac{1}{x}$
	  Exponential|$a^x$
	  Root|$\sqrt{x}$
	  Log|$log(x)$
	  Tragicomic|$sin,cos,tan,etc$
	  
	  then it is **[[Continuity|Continuous]] on its [[Domain]]**. 
- ## [[Continuity]] of a [[Multi-Variable Function]]
	- A [[Multi-Variable Function]] is [[Continuity|Continuous]] at a point if its [[Limit]] at that point exists.
	  ![[Limit#^03f58f]]
	- An easier way to determine [[Continuity]] of a [[Multi-Variable Function]] to check if the [[Multi-Variable Function]] is the sum of  [[Continuity|Continuous]] single-variable functions. If it is then the [[Multi-Variable Function]] is [[Continuity|Continuous]] as well.
