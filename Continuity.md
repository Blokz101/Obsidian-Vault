- ## Definition
	- A [[Function]] is a [[Continuity|Continuous]] for its [[Domain]] if it can be sketched without the need to left your pencil.
	- If the [[Limit|Right Hand Limit]], [[Limit|Left Hand Limit]], and function itself are defined at an $x$ then the function is continuous at that $x$.
- ## Continuous functions
	- If the function is one of the following
	  
	  Function|Equation
	  ---|---
	  Polynomial|$ax^3+bx+c$
	  Rational|$\frac{1}{x}$
	  Exponential|$a^x$
	  Root|$\sqrt{x}$
	  Log|$log(x)$
	  Tragicomic|$sin,cos,tan,etc$
	  
	  then it is **[[Continuity|Continuous]] on its [[Domain]]**.
