#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The [[Force]] of the attraction to the [[Nucleus]] felt by the [[Electron|Electrons]].
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$Z_{eff}=Z-\sigma$$
	  > 
	  > $Z_{eff}$ = [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] (Units Unknown)
	  > $Z$ = [[Atomic Number]] ([[Integer]])
	  > $\sigma$ = [[Shielding Constant]] (Units Unknown)
	  
  - The more [[Proton|Protons]] in the [[Nucleus]] the stronger the [[Effective Nuclear Charge]].
- ## Trends ^eb9b1e
	- #### Note:
		- Most of this can be based off of the fact that $Z_{eff}$ is much greater for [[Electron|Electrons]] close to the [[Nucleus]] then for [[Electron|Electrons]] far away from the [[Nucleus]].
	- #### $Z_{eff}$ Trend for [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]]
		- **$Z_{eff}$ increases as you move from left to right on the [[Periodic Table]]** because there are more [[Proton|Protons]].
		- **$Z_{eff}$ sharply drops as you move the end of one row to the beginning of another** because the new [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Level]] is farther from the [[Nucleus]] and therefore the attraction [[Force]] is weaker.

	- #### [[Atomic Radius]]
		- The [[Atomic Radius]] increases from **right to left and top to bottom**.
		- Because the [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases from **right to left** and as you move down you add more [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Levels]] and therefore there are more [[Electron|Electrons]] farther away from the [[Nucleus]].
		- **See chart below.**
	- #### [[Electronegativity]] and [[Ionization Energy]]
		- Both increase from **left to right and bottom to top**
		- Because the [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases from **left to right** and as you move up you drop [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Levels]] and therefore the [[Electron|Electrons]] that are being attracted are being attracted into an [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Level]] that is much closer to the [[Nucleus]].

	- #### Orbital [[Energy]]
		- Given by this equation located in the [[Bohr's Model]] note:
		  ![[Bohr's Model#^9d1d37]]
		- Increases from **right to left and top to bottom**.
		- Because as [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases so does the energy and as the [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Level]] increases the [[Energy]] decreases because it gets farther from the [[Nucleus]].
