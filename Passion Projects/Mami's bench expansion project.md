## Progress
**June 6th 2022 - 09:13:20 pm** 
Earlier in the day I finished designing the bench expansion for Mami in [[Fusion 360]]

I have determined that I need the following in wood for the project:
- 6 2x4x8
- 1 2x4x4
- 3 1x6x8

Going to buy the wood now.

Just got back with the wood that I needed. Papi has the 2x4s in the shop and I just bought 3 1x6s.

Finished cutting the extra wood off of the bench
