## Progress
**June 6th 2022 - 09:13:20 pm** 
Earlier in the day I finished designing the bench expansion for Mami in [[Fusion 360]]

**June 8th 2022 - 02:52:13 pm** 
I have determined that I need the following in wood for the project:
- 6 2x4x8
- 1 2x4x4
- 3 1x6x8

Going to buy the wood now.

**June 8th 2022 - 04:09:03 pm** 
Just got back with the wood that I needed. Papi has the 2x4s in the shop and I just bought 3 1x6s.

**June 9th 2022 - 04:40:31 pm** 
Finished cutting the extra wood off of the bench.

**June 10th 2022 - 04:35:22 pm** 
Cut the three deck planks and took an ice cream break with my family.

**June 10th 2022 - 04:46:02 pm** 
Finished cutting the sides supports for the deck planks

**June 11th 2022 - 12:38:49 pm** 
Finished creating the frame and nailed the deck planks to it. Upon further consultation I am going to add more supports underneath the deck planks. It will take a little longer but be much stronger.

**June 11th 2022 - 12:55:47 pm** 
Just realized that a dimension that was supposed to be 16.25 was actually 16.75, we are now running with that. I just updated the CAD model.

**June 11th 2022 - 01:35:33 pm** 
Finished adding the new supports and cut some of the wood that will be for the stand.

**June 11th 2022 - 01:54:22 pm** 
Finished cutting the other support pieces and arranged them to be nailed in.

**June 11th 2022 - 03:40:09 pm** 
Finished putting up the four pieces that will hold up the frame.
