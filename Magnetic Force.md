- ## Definition
	- Attraction or repulsion between electrically charged particles because of their motion.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{F}$ = [[Electric Force]] in $N$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] of a [[Proton]] in $C$
	  > $\vec{v}$ = [[Velocity]] in $\frac{m}{s}$
	  > $\vec{B}$ = [[Magnetic Field]] in $T$
