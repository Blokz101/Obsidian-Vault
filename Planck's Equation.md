- ## Definition
	- This equation relates [[Energy (Chemistry)]] to [[Frequency Of Light]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$E=h*v$$
	  > 
	  > $E$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] (J)
	  > $h$ = [[Planck's Constant]] = $6.626e-34$ ($Js$)
	  > $v$ = [[Frequency Of Light]] ($s^{-1}$ ). ^0cca3d
- ## Reference
	- A characteristic of a wave on the [[Spectrum of Light]].
	- [[Energy (Chemistry)]] and [[Frequency Of Light]] are **directly** related.
	- [[Frequency Of Light]] and [[Wavelength]] are **Inversely** related (See [[Wavelength|Wavelengths]]).
