- ## Definition
	- The force that one [[Proton]] or [[Electron]] has on another [[Proton]] or [[Electron]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{\text{electric}}=|\vec{F}_{\text{electric}}|*\hat{r}}$$
	  > $$\large{|\vec{F}_{\text{electric}}|=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}*\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{|\vec{r}|^2}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{F}_{\text{electric}}$ = The [[Electric Force]] in $N$
	  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	  > $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$ = $9e9\frac{Nm^2}{c^2}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position of [[Charge]] source 1 to position of [[Charge]] source 2 in $m$

	  > The [[Charge|Charges]] are only attracted to each other when the arrows connect the two [[Charge|Charges]]. If they do not connect, then they repel.
