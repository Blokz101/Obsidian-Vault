#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- A real number given by the slope of a the [[Tangent Line]] at that point. Notated as $f'(x)$
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$f'(x)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x-h)-f(x)}{h}$$
	  > 
	  > Provided that the limit exists.
	- This is called [[Derivative|Differentiation]]. 
	- > [!Warning]
	  > The function must be [[Continuity|Continuous]] at the point that you want to take the [[Derivative]] of. The limit may exist, but [[Continuity]] is required for [[Derivative|Differentiation]].
