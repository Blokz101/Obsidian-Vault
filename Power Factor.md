- ## Definition
	- Measured in degrees/radians.
	- Part of [[Real Power|AC Real Power]]:
		- >[!Equation]
		  > $$\text{Power Factor}=\large{\cos(\theta_{v}-\theta_{i})}$$
		  > $\text{Power Factor Angle}=\theta_{v}-\theta_{i}$
	- A **unity power factor** is a [[Power Factor]] such that $\theta_{v}-\theta_{i}=0$.
