- ## Definition
	- Measured in degrees/radians.
	- Part of [[Real Power|AC Real Power]]:
		- >[!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\text{Power Factor}=\cos(\theta_{v}-\theta_{i})}$$
		  > $$\large{\text{Power Factor Angle}=\theta_{s}=\theta_{v}-\theta_{i}}$$
	- [[Power Factor]] can also be found using the [[Power Triangle]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\text{Power Factor}=\frac{P}{S}}$$
		  > 
		  > $P$ = [[Real Power]] in $W$
		  > $S$ = [[Complex Power]] in $VA$
	- A **unity power factor** is a [[Power Factor]] such that $\theta_{s}=0$.
