- ## Definition
	- Measured in degrees/radians.
	- Is a measure of how in sync the [[Sinusoidal Signal|Sinusoidal Signals]] of [[Voltage]] and [[Current]] are
	- Part of [[Real Power|AC Real Power]]:
		- >[!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\text{Power Factor}=\cos(\theta_{v}-\theta_{i})}$$
	- The [[Power Factor|Power Factor Angle]] is also the [[Power Factor|Phase of Complex Power]].
		- >[!Equation]
		    > $$\large{\theta_{s} =\theta _v-\theta_{i}}$$
		    > 
		    > $\theta_{s}$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]] of [[Complex Power]] in degrees/radians
		    > $\theta_{v}$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]] of [[Voltage]] signal in degrees/radians
		    > $\theta_{i}$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]] of [[Current]] signal in degrees/radians ^fa5f00
	- [[Power Factor]] can also be found using the [[Power Triangle]].

	- A **unity power factor** is a [[Power Factor]] such that $\theta_{s}=0$.
