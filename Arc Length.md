#Permanent [[Calculus II]]

- ## Definition
	- The length of an arc can be found by picking points along the arc and drawing lines between them. The more lines, the better the approximation.
	- ![[IMG_BEA84264F537-1.jpeg|400]]
	- The true [[Arc Length]] is given when the amount of lines reaches infinity.
	- There are three variants.

	  > The [[Pythagorean Theorem]] gives us the length of the line segments.
	  > $$\text{Distance}=\sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2 }$$
	  > Generalizing this:
	  > $$\text{Distance}=\sqrt{ (\Delta x_{2})^2+(\Delta y_{2})^2 }$$

	  > $$\large{\text{Area}=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 } \, dx}$$
