- ## Definition
	- Maps values from the **domain [[Set]]** to **codomain [[Set]]**.
		- Think of the **domain** as the input.
		- Think of the **codomain** as the output.
	- Notated as $f:A\to B$ for a function $f$ that maps domain [[Set]] $A$ to codomain [[Set]] $B$.
- #### Terminology
	- A [[Function (Discrete Math)]] is [[Function (Discrete Math)|Injective]] if no two values of the domain map to the same value of the codomain.
	- A [[Function (Discrete Math)]] is [[Function (Discrete Math)|Surjective]] if every value in the codomain has a mapped value from the domain.
	- A [[Function (Discrete Math)]] is [[Function (Discrete Math)|Bijective]] if it is both [[Function (Discrete Math)|Injective]] and [[Function (Discrete Math)|Surjective]].
