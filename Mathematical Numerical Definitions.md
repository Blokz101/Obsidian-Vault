- ## Definition
	- Definitions of numerical types. These definitions can be used in logic without having to prove them.
- #### Even and Odd Numbers
	- > [!Equation]
	  > An integer $x$ is **even** if there is an integer $k$ such that $x=2k$.
	  > An integer $x$ is **odd** if there is an integer $k$ such that $x=2k+1$.
- #### Rational Number
	- > [!Equation]
	  > An integer $x$ is **rational** if there exists integers $a$ and $b$ such that $x=\frac{a}{b}$ when $b\neq 0$.
- #### Division
	- > [!Equation]
	  > An integer $x$ **divides** an integer $y$ if there is an integer $k$ such that $y=kx$ when $x\neq 0$.
