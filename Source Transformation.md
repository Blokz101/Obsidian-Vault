- ## Definition
	- The process of replacing a [[Voltage Source]] in series with a [[Resistor]] with a [[Current Source]] in parallel with a [[Resistor]].

	- These two circuits are equivalent provided that they have the same [[Voltage]] between the two terminals and the same [[Current]] flowing though them.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > To find the value of the equivalent [[Current Source]] or [[Voltage]] just apply [[Ohm's Law]]:
	  > $$\large{V_{s}=I_{s}R}$$
	  > $$\large{I_{s}=\frac{V_{s}}{R}}$$
