- ## Definition
	- > [!Equation]
	  > If $f$ is [[Continuity|Continuous]] on $[a,b]$ then there exists some value $C$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(C)=$[[Average Value Of A Function]]:
	  > $$\large{f(C)=f_{avg}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx}$$
	  > In simpler terms: If $f(x)$ is [[Continuity|Continuous]] on $[a,b]$ then that segment of $f(x)$ has an average value, $f(x)_{adv}$, and there is some value between $a$ and $b$ where $f(x)=f_{avg}$. $C$ is the $x$ value where $f(x)=f_{avg}$.
