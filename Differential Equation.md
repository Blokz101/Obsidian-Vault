- ## Definition
	- An equation that contains at least one [[Derivative]] of an **unknown function**.

		  > Find a [[Differential Equation]] to find a position of time function for the ball.
		  > $$\begin{align}
	 h(t) & =\text{position function} \\
	 h''(t) & =\text{acceleration function} \\
	 & = -g
		\end{align}$$
	- There are two general types:
		- Ordinary [[Differential Equation]] (ODE)
		- Partial [[Differential Equation]] (PDE)
	- The **order** of a [[Differential Equation]] is the highest order of the [[Derivative]] of the **unknown function**.
