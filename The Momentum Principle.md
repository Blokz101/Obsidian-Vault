- ## Definition
	- The change in [[Momentum]] is equal to the [[Net Force]] acting on the [[System]] multiplied by the [[Time]] interval during which the change took place.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\Delta \vec{p}=\vec{F}_{net}*\Delta t}$$
	  > 
	  > $\Delta \vec{p}$ = Change in [[Momentum]] in $\frac{kg\:m}{s}$
	  > $\vec{F}_{net}$ = [[Net Force]] in $N$
	  > $\Delta t$ = Change in [[Time]] in $s$
	- **Change in [[Momentum]] is the same as [[Impulse]].**
- ## [[Derivative]] Form
	- > [!Equation]
	  >  $$\large{\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=\vec{F}_{net}}$$
	  > $$\large{\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}}$$
