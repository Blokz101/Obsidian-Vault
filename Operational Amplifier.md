- ## Definition
	- An [[Electrical Component|Active Component]] designed to perform mathematical operations when electrical components are connected to its terminals.

	- It can:
		- Sum signals
		- Amplify signals
		- Integrate
		- Differentiate
	- An ideal [[Operational Amplifier]] has:
		- Infinite [[open loop]] [[Gain]]
		- Infinite input [[Resistance]]
		- Zero output [[Resistance]]
	- These ideal properties  imply that:
		- There is no [[Voltage]] difference between the input terminals. In other words if you know the [[Voltage]] of one terminal you know the [[Voltage]] of the other. $Vn=Vp$
		- There is no [[Current]] flowing into the [[Operational Amplifier]] but there can be [[Current]] flowing out of $V_{o}$. This [[Current]] is unknown though and depends on the rest of the circuit.
	- When performing [[Circuit Analysis]] it is generally easiest to use [[Node Voltage Circuit Analysis]].
