- ## Definition
	- Also known as the [[Discrete Random Variable Distribution|Probability Mass Function]] or [[Discrete Random Variable Distribution|PMF]].
	- For every possible value $x$ of the random variable, the [[Discrete Random Variable Distribution|PMF]] specifies the [[Probability]] of observing that value $x$, when the experiment is performed.
	- Generally comes in the form of a table with **outcomes or values** on top and **[[Probability|Probabilities]]** on bottom.
