- ## Definition
	- Monoatomic means they derive from a single [[Atom]] where [[Electron|Electrons]] have been added or removed.
- ## Notes
	- [[Charge|Charges]] ^bd0b9a
		- They like to gain or loose enough [[Electron|Electrons]] to be equal to the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] of the nearest [[Noble Gas]].
		- The chart below shows the charges of each [[Monoatomic Ion]].

- ## Names
	- [[Ion|Cations]]
		- For [[Element|Elements]] whose [[Charge]] is simple one, the name is the same as the [[Element]].
		- Ex. $Na$: Sodium Atom -> $Na^{1+}$ : Sodium Ion
	- [[Ion|Anions]]
		- Use the name of the [[Element]] with the suffix "ide"
		- Ex. $N^{3-}$: Nitride, $O^{2-}$: Oxide,	$F^{1-}$: Fluoride
- ## Reference
	- Is a type of [[Ion]].
