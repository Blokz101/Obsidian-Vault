#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- Note
	- **[[Ion|Ions]] are always charged, never neutral**
		- Positively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Cations]] while negatively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Anions]]
	- There are two types:
		- Monoatomic meaning they derive from a single [[Atom]]
		- Polyatomic meaning they drive from multiple [[Atoms]]
	- An [[Ion|Ions]] charge always appears as subscript to its [[Ion]]. Ex $ $Fe^{3+}$, $Cl^{1-}$, $NH_4^{1+}$, $SO_4^{2-}$.
