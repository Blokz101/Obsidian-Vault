- ## Definition
	- An objects ability to resist [[Angular Acceleration]].
	- Think of it as the same as mass for translational motion. The larger the mass, the harder it is to get it moving at some [[Velocity]], the larger the [[Moment Of Inertia]] the harder it is to get it moving at some [[Angular Velocity]].
