- ## Definition
	- A way of representing [[Resistance]] in the [[Phasor Domain]].
	- Measured in $\Omega$.
- #### Resistor
	- [[Resistor|Resistors]] are completely real. So a [[Resistor]] with a resistance of $4\Omega$ will have an [[Impedance]] of $4\Omega$.
- #### Capacitor
	- A [[Capacitor]] generally has a **negative** [[Impedance]].
	- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{Z_{C}=\frac{1}{j\omega C}}$$
			  > 
			  > $Z_{C}$ = [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
			  > $\omega$ = $2\pi f$ where $f$ is [[Frequency]]
			  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $C$ ^901ff2
- #### Inductor
	- A [[Inductor]] generally has a **positive** [[Impedance]].
	- > [!Equation] 
			  > $$\large{Z_{L}=j\omega L}$$
			  > 
			  > $Z_{L}$ = [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
			  > $\omega$ = $2\pi f$ where $f$ is [[Frequency]]
			  > $L$ = [[Inductance]] in $H$ ^c0f7f8
