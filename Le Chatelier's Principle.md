#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- When a system at [[Equilibrium]] is placed under **stress**, it will respond in such a way that relieves as much **stress** as possible.
		- We can use this to force a reaction to do what we want it to.
	- Assume we have a reaction at [[Equilibrium]] and apply the stress of:
		- Adding reactants.
			- The **reaction shifts right** to use up some of the extra **reactant** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

		- Remove reactant.
			- The **reaction shifts left** to create more **reactant** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

		- Remove product.
			- The **reaction shifts right** to create more **product** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

		- Add product
			- The **reaction shifts left** to use up some of the extra **product** to restore [[Equilibrium]].
