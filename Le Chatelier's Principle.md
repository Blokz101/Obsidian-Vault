#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- When a system at [[Equilibrium]] is placed under **stress**, it will respond in such a way that relieves as much **stress** as possible.
	- Assume we have a reaction at [[Equilibrium]] and apply the stress of:
		- Adding reactants.
			- The **reaction shifts right** to use up some of the extra **reactant** to restore [[Equilibrium]].
				- ![[IMG_C6669C7B438B-1.jpeg|400]]
		- Remove reactant.
			- The **reaction shifts left** to create more **reactant** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

		- Remove product.
			- The **reaction shifts right** to create more **product** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

		- Add product
			- The **reaction shifts left** to use up some of the extra **product** to restore [[Equilibrium]].

	- > [!Warning]
	  > In general, to apply stress to the reaction, the part of the reaction that we are affecting has to be accounted for in the [[Equilibrium|Equilibrium Constant Expression]].
	  > 
	  > This means that affecting the amounts of liquid or solids in a reaction will have a negligible effect.
	- We can use this principle to force a reaction to do what we want it to.

		  > If we want to maximize the yield of **Ethyl Acetate** given this reaction:

		  > We can remove **water** as its formed to apply stress and push the reaction forwards.
