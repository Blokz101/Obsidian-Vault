- #### Laws of Propositional Inference with Quantifiers
	- An **Arbitrary** element is an element that has properties shared by all elements in the domain and has no special properties. 
		- These elements can be generalized to all elements in the domain.
	- A **Particular** element is an element in the domain that may have special properties not shared by all other elements in the domain.
		- These elements may not be generalized to all elements in the domain.
