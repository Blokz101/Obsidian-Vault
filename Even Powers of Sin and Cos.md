- ## Definition
	- In order to integrate $Sin$ or $Cos$ that are raised to a high **odd** power we can use this this formula to expand them:
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\sin^2x=\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos^2x)}$$
	  > $$\large{\cos^2x=\frac{1}{2}(1+\cos^2x)}$$
	- This comes from the [[Double Angle Identities]]:
