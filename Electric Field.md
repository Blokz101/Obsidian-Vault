- ## Definition
	- The [[Electric Field]] is the field of force that [[Charge|Charges]] exert on all other [[Charge|Charges]] in the field.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{E}_{\text{at x}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}*\frac{Q}{|\vec{r}|^2}\hat{r}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}*\frac{Q}{|\vec{r}|^{3/2}}\vec{r}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{E}_{\text{at x}}$ = [[Electric Field]] at observation point $x$ in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	  > $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$ = $9e9\frac{Nm^2}{c^2}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position of [[Charge]] to observation point $x$ in $m$
  - When multiple [[Charge|Charges]] are present, the [[Electric Field]] is the sum of the [[Electric Field|Electric Fields]] created by each of the [[Charge|Charges]].
  - The [[Electric Field]] can be calculated from an [[Electromagnetic Force]] and [[Charge]], and vice versa.
    > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}}$$
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}=\vec{E}q}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{E}$ = [[Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $\vec{F}$ = [[Force]] in $N$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] of object feeling the force in $C$
	- We can move [[Charge|Charges]] by using the attractive and repulsive properties of [[Charge|Charges]] as defined by [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].
