- ## Definition
	- The [[Electric Field]] is the field of force that [[Charge|Charges]] on all other charged particles in the field.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{E}$ = [[Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $\vec{F}$ = [[Force]] in $N$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	- The [[Electric Field]] has a direction and magnitude.

	- Opposites attract, everything else repels as stated by the [[Electromagnetic Force]]. 
	- We can move [[Charge|Charges]] by using the attractive and repulsive properties of [[Charge|Charges]] as defined by [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].
