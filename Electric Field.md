- ## Definition
	- The [[Electric Field]] is the field of force that [[Charge|Charges]] on all other charged particles in the field.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{E=\frac{F}{q}}$$
	  > 
	  > $E$ = ?
	  > $F$ = [[Force]] in $N$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] in ?
	- The [[Electric Field]] has a direction and magnitude.

	- We can move [[Charge|Charges]] by using the attractive and repulsive properties of [[Charge|Charges]] as defined by [[Coulomb's Law of Force]].
