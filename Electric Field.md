- ## Definition
	- The [[Electric Field]] is the field of force that [[Charge|Charges]] exert on all other [[Charge|Charges]] in the field.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{\text{electric at x}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}*\frac{Q_{1}}{\vec{r}^2}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{F}_{\text{electric}}$ = [[Electromagnetic Force]] felt by $Q_{1}$ in $N$
	  > $Q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	  > $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$ = $9e9\frac{Nm^2}{c^2}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position of [[Charge]] to observation point $x$ in $m$
	- The [[Electric Field]] has a direction and magnitude.
  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{E}$ = [[Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $\vec{F}$ = [[Force]] in $N$
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
	- We can move [[Charge|Charges]] by using the attractive and repulsive properties of [[Charge|Charges]] as defined by [[Coulomb's Law of Force (Chemistry)]].
