	- Want to use this kind of system when you have information about the either the **load** or **source** and need to solve for the other.
	- Can solve for the line currents by doing a [[Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law|KVL]] on one of the lines and back across the neutral line.

		  > $\tilde{I}_{a}$ = [[Phasor]] [[Current]] on line $a$ in $A$

		  > $z_{l}$ = Line [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
		  > $z_{y}$ = Load [[Impedance]] in $\Omega$
