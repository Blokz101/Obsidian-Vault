- ## Definition
	- If the **absolute value** of the [[Infinite Series|Series]] is **convergent**.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > A [[Infinite Series|Series]] is [[Absolute Convergence|Absolutely Convergent]] if:
	  > $$\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\lvert a_{n} \rvert}\text{ is Convergent}$$
	- If a [[Infinite Series|Series]] is [[Absolute Convergence|Absolutely Convergent]] it must also be **conditionally convergent** as well.
