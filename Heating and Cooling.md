- ## Definition
	- [[Physical Process]] where [[Heat]] is added or removed.
- ## Calculating Energy Difference
	- Equation
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$q=m*c*\triangle T$$
	  > $q$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] in Joules
	  > $m$ = [[Mass]] in Grams
	  > $c$ = [[Specific Heat Capacity]] in $\frac{J}{g}$
	  > $\triangle T$ = Change in [[Temperature]] in [[Celsius]]
