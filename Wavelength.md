- ## Definition
	- The length an [[Electromagnetic Wave]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\lambda=\frac{S}{v}$$
	  > 
	  > $S$ = [[Speed of Light]] (Meters/Second) = $3.0e8m/s$
	  > $\lambda$ = [[Wavelength]] (Meters)
	  > $v$ = [[Frequency Of Light]] ([[Hertz]])
	- The **longer** the [[Wavelength]].
		- The **lower** the [[Energy (Chemistry)]].
		- The **lower** the [[Frequency Of Light]].
	- The **shorter** the [[Wavelength]].
		- The **higher** the [[Energy (Chemistry)]].
		- The **higher** the [[Frequency Of Light]].
- ## Reference
	- A characteristic of a wave on the [[Spectrum of Light]].
	- [[Energy (Chemistry)]] and [[Frequency Of Light]] are **directly** related (See [[Planck's Equation]]).
	- [[Frequency Of Light]] and [[Wavelength]] are **Inversely** related.
