- ## Definition
	- A method to represent fractions in [[Binary]].
	- Works the same as representation system as [[Unsigned Integer|Unsigned Integers]] or [[Signed Integer|Signed Integers]], but uses negative exponents of $2^n$ and a [[Binary Point]] to separate them:

	- Convert to negatives and back the same way as normal with [[Two's Complement|2C]]:
		- ![[Two's Complement#^3e6d6a]]
	- [[Fixed-Point Code]] Exponent Table

	- To represent a large verity of values we need [[Floating-Point Code]] or a code where the [[Binary Point]] is not fixed.
