- ## Definition
	- A method for finding the global maximum or minimum of a function. Normally this function is bounded by points or another function.
- ## Single Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- Same as [[Local Optimization]], but check the points that the function is bounded by.
- ## Multi Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- If the function is bounded by lines then 
	- If the function is bounded by another function then it is best to use the [[Lagrange Multiplier]].
