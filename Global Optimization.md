- ## Definition
	- A method for finding the global maximum or minimum of a function. Normally this function is bounded by points or another function.
- ## Single Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- Same as [[Local Optimization]], but check the points that the function is bounded by.
- ## Multi Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- If the function is bounded by lines then:
		- Perform [[Local Optimization]] and ignore the [[Critical Point (Calculus)|Critical Points]] outside the boundary.
		- Add the end points of each line to the **points of interest**.
		- Plug 
	- If the function is bounded by another function then it is best to use the [[Lagrange Multiplier]].
