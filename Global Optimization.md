- ## Definition
	- A method for finding the global maximum or minimum of a function. Normally this function is bounded by points or another function.
- ## Single Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- Same as [[Local Optimization]], but check the points that the function is bounded by.
- ## Multi Variable [[Global Optimization]]
	- There are methods of [[Global Optimization]] or [[Global Optimization|Constrained Optimization]], however in most cases it is best to use the [[Lagrange Multiplier]].
