#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A change from one [[States Of Matter|State of Matter]] to another.
- ## [[Entropy]] and [[Enthalpy]]
	- During a [[Phase Change]] the [[Entropy]] and [[Enthalpy]] are always known.
		- #### Changing from a [[Solid]] > [[Liquid]] > [[Gas]]:
			- [[Entropy]] **Increases** as the [[Molecule|Molecules]] become less restricted and therefore more disorderly.
			- [[Enthalpy]] **Increases** as [[Energy (Chemistry)]] is absorbed to push the [[Molecule|Molecules]] farther apart and change [[States Of Matter]].
		- #### Changing from a [[Gas]] > [[Liquid]] > [[Solid]]:
			- [[Entropy]] **Decreases** as the molecules become more restricted and therefore orderly.
			- [[Enthalpy]] **Decreases** as [[Energy (Chemistry)]] is released to allow the [[Molecule|Molecules]] to pack closer together and change [[States Of Matter]].

	- A [[Phase Diagram]] relates [[Phase Change]] to [[Temperature]] and [[Pressure]]
