- ## Definition
	- The [[Force]] that a spring exerts is directly proportional to its [[Displacement]] from its **natural length**.
	- Spring Constant Symbol: $k$
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{F=kx}$$
	  > 
	  > $F$ = [[Force]] in [[Newton|N]]
	  > $k$ = [[Hooke's Law|Spring Constant]]
	  > $x$ = [[Displacement]] from natural length in meters
