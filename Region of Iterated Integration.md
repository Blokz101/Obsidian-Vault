- ## Type 1 Region
	- A [[Region of Iterated Integration]] defined by complex functions in terms of $y$ and simple bounds in terms of $x$.
		- > Type I regions are also known as “vertically simple” or “y-simple” regions. Such regions are vertically connected in the sense that all points on a vertical line connecting any two points in the region must also lie in the region. In Figure 33 we have an example of a region that is not vertically connected, as points P and Q are connected by a vertical line, but not all points on that line are in the region.

- ## Type 2 Region
	- A [[Region of Iterated Integration]] defined by complex functions in terms if $x$ and simple bounds in terms of $y$.
