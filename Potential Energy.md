- ## Definition
	- Because the change in [[Energy (Physics)]] in the universe is always 0, when [[Work (Physics)]] is done on a system, the [[Energy (Physics)]] has to come from somewhere. It comes from [[Potential Energy]].
	- [[Potential Energy]] only occurs between two objects. [[Potential Energy]] will always be in reference to another object, and therefore requires a system with more than one object in it.
