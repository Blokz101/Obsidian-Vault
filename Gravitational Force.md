- ## Definition
	- The force of **gravity** between two objects.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > 
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{g}=|\vec{F}_{g}|*\hat{r}_{\text{1 to 2}}}$$
	  > $$\large{|\vec{F}_{g}|=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{|\vec{r}_{\text{1 to 2}}|^2}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{F}_{g}$ = The [[Gravitational Force]] acting on **object 1** by **object 2** in $N$
	  > $\vec{r}_{\text{1 to 2}}$ = [[Position]] [[Vector]] from **object 1** to **object 2** in $m$
	  > $G$ = [[Gravitational Constant]] or $6.7e-11  \frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$
	  > $m$ = [[Mass]] of the object in $kg$
	  
	- > [!Official Equation]-
	  > > [!Warning]
	  > > This is the official equation and it works, but its really fucked up and not intuitive to use. Be careful with your position vector if you use it.
	  >
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{g}=-G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{|\vec{r}|^2}\hat{r}}$$
	  > $$\large{\vec{r}=\vec{r}_{2}-\vec{r}_{1}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{F}_{g}$ = [[Gravitational Force]] acting on **object 2** by **object 1** in $N$
	  > $G$ = [[Gravitational Constant]] or $6.7e-11  \frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$
	  > $m_{\text{1 or 2}}$ = [[Mass]] of Object in $kg$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = The [[Position]] [[Vector]] from **object 1** to **object 2** in $m$
