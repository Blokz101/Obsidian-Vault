- ## Definition
	- The force of **gravity** between two objects.
	- For the two equations below assume there are two objects. To find the [[Gravitational Force]] acting on **object 2** by **object 1**. We can assume  **object 1** to be the center of focus and the relative origin. Therefore **$\large{\vec{r}}$** is the [[Position]] [[Vector]] from **object 1** to **object 2**.
		- For example, if you have a planet and star, and want to find the [[Gravitational Force]] acting on the planet by the star, you consider the star to be the origin for your calculations.
