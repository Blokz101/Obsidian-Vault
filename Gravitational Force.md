- ## Definition
	- The force of **gravity** between two objects.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{\text{grav on 2 by 1}}=-G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{|\vec{r}^2|}\hat{r}}$$
	  > 
	  > $G$ = [[Gravitational Constant]] or $6.7e-11  \frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$.
	  > $m_{\text{1 or 2}}$ = [[Mass]] of Object in $kg$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = The [[Position]] [[Vector]] from object $1$ to $2$ in $m$
