#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- How overall positive or negative an [[Ion]] is.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$c=p-e$$
	  > 
	  > $c$ = [[Charge]] (integer)
	  > $p$ = [[Proton|Protons]] (integer)
	  > $e$ = [[Electron|Electrons]] (integer)
- ## Predicting Charges
	- #### Cation
		- The [[Charge]] is the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] lost.
		- This is generally the column number.
	- #### Anion
		- The charge is the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] gained.
		- This is generally the column number minus 8.
- ## Reference
	- Is dependent on [[Proton|Protons]] and [[Electron|Electrons]].
	- [[Charge]] applies to [[Molecule|Molecules]] and [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] applies to [[Element|Elements]].
