- ## Definition
	- How overall positive or negative an [[Ion]] is.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Each [[Electron]] and [[Proton]] have the following symbol and charge:
	  > $$\large{e^-=-1.6e-19C}$$
	  > $$\large{p^+=1.6e-19C}$$
	- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{c=p-e}$$
		  > 
		  > $c$ = [[Charge]] in $C$
		  > $p$ = [[Proton|Protons]] in $C$
		  > $e$ = [[Electron|Electrons]] in $C$
- ## Predicting Charges
	- #### Cation
		- The [[Charge]] is the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] lost.
		- This is generally the column number on the [[Periodic Table]].
	- #### Anion
		- The charge is the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] gained.
		- This is generally the column number minus 8 on the [[Periodic Table]].

- ## Practice (Physics)
	- 
- ## Reference
	- Is dependent on [[Proton|Protons]] and [[Electron|Electrons]].
	- [[Charge]] applies to [[Molecule|Molecules]] and [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] applies to [[Element|Elements]].
