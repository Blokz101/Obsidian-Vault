- ## Definition
	- Simply [[Decibel]] but with reference to a [[Power]] of $1\,dB$. Basically [[Decibel]] but describing [[Power]].
		- Basically a unit made for representing [[Power]] in a [[Logarithm|Logarithmic]] way.
	- The conventional unit for the [[Power Spectrum]].
	- Notated as $dBW$.
	- Conversions to and from $W$ and $dBW$:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P_{[dBW]}=10\log_{10}(P_{[dB]})}$$
	  > and
	  > $$\large{P_{[dB]}=10^{\frac{P_{[dBW]}}{10}}}$$
