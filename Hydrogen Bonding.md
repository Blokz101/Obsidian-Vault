#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^f5ad4a
	- The strongest type of [[Intramolecular Forces|Intramolecular Force]] and stronger type of [[Dipole Forces|Dipole Force]].
	- When a **Hydrogen** [[Atom]] that is **bonded** to either **N**, **O** or **F** gets near another [[Atom]] with **lone pairs**.
		- For an atom to [[Hydrogen Bonding|Hydrogen Bond]] it must have one of the following bonds, and the **non-hydrogen** atom must have an open spot in its [[Electron Region]] to form the [[Hydrogen Bonding|Hydrogen Bond]].
			- H-N Bond
			- H-O Bond
			- H-F Bond
		- This can occur because **N**, **O** and **F** are **small** and have **high [[Electronegativity]]**, therefore they pull [[Electron|Electrons]] away from **hydrogen** and to themselves. This creates an especially strong negative [[Dipole (Chemistry)]].
