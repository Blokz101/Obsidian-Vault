- ## Definition
	- Many [[Differential Equation]] can be solved, but many cannot be solved with elementary equations. Therefore we can approximate the solution using [[Euler’s Method]].
	- [[Euler’s Method]] assume that if we find a [[Tangent Line]] at a point on the solution curve, we can approximate the next value with the [[Tangent Line]].

		- When $dx$ / $\Delta x$ is small, $\Delta y$ is close to $dy$ and therefore the approximation is accurate.
	- Find the next point like this:

		  > $$\large{y_{i+1}=y_{i}+m_{i}\Delta x}$$
		  > In general we can apply Euler’s Method to first order [[Differential Equation|Differential Equations]] by finding the slope ($m_{i}$) with the first order [[Differential Equation]].
