#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- A collection of objects or items
	  > [!Example]
	  > Items to wear or Pet names
- ## Notation
	- List the items separated by commas and with the list enclosed in curly brackets
	  > [!Example]
	  > Items to wear = {Pants, Shirt, Watch, Socks, Shoes, ...}
	- The use of `...` means that the list continues beyond what is written. If it is used for a list of things with known items then the ending of that list has to be shown after the `...`. Refer to the `Days of  the week` example.
	  > [!Example]
	  > Integers = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
	  > Days of the week = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ..., Sunday}
	- Statements about a variable in the [[Set]] can be written as `{x|statement}` or `{x : statement}` where x is the list of variables in the [[Set]].
	  > [!Example]
	  > `{Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday | Begins with T}` is the same as `{Tuesday, Thursday}`
	  > 
	  > `{x | `$x^3-2x-3x=0$`}` is the same as the roots of $x^3-2x-3x=0$ or `{-1, 0, 3}`
