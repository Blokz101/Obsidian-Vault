- ## Definition
	- A collection of objects or items
	  > [!Example]
	  > Items to wear or Pet names
- ## Notation
	- List the items separated by commas and with the list enclosed in curly brackets
	  > [!Example]
	  > Items to wear = {Pants, Shirt, Watch, Socks, Shoes, ...}
	- The use of `...` means that the list continues beyond what is written. If it is used for a list of things with known items then the ending of that list has to be shown after the `...`. Refer to the `Days of  the week` example.
	  > [!Example]
	  > Integers = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
	  > Days of the week = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ..., Sunday}
