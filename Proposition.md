- ## Definition
	- A statement that is either **true** or **false**.
		- > [!Example]
		  > Statements that are [[Proposition|Propositions]]:
		  > - There are an infinite number of prime numbers
		  > - 17 is an even number
		  > - Two plus two is four
		  > - The movie was funny
		  >   
		  > Statements that are not [[Proposition|Propositions]]:
		  > - What time is it
		  > - Are you awake
		  > - Have a nice day
		  > - $x$ is an odd number
- #### Argument, Hypotheses, and Conclusion
	- An **Argument** is a series of individual [[Proposition|Propositions]]. Individual [[Proposition|Propositions]] in an **Argument** are called **Hypotheses**.
	- The **Conclusion** is the final [[Proposition]] in an **Argument**.
	- Notated like this:

		  > ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 10.16.37 PM.png]]
		  > The letters $h$ represent different **Arguments**. The $c$ represents the **Conclusion**. Lastly, $\therefore$ means therefore. 
		  > 
		  > This is equivalent to:
		  > $$\large{(h_{1}\land h_{2}\land\dots \land h_{n})\to c}$$
