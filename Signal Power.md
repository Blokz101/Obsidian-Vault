- ## Definition
	- The average [[Power]] dissipated over a $1\Omega$ [[Resistor]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P=\frac{V_{rms}^2}{1}=V_{rms}^2}$$
	  > After substituting [[Voltage|V]] [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] for [[V RMS of a Sinusoidal Waveform]]:
	  > $$\large{P=\frac{V_{p}^2}{2}}$$
	  > $P$ = [[Signal Power]] in $W$
	  > $V_{rms}$ = [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{p}$ = [[Amplitude]] in $V$
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > To find the **power of the $V_{dc}$ component** of a [[Periodic Signal]] (The component of the signal at $0\,Hz$) using the convention of the $1\Omega$ [[Resistor]], the equation will be:
	  > > $$\large{P=V_{dc}^2}$$
	- [[Signal Power]] is useful as a standard for measuring and comparing the [[Power]] of different [[Periodic Signal|Periodic Signals]].
