- ## Definition
	- The average [[Power]] dissipated over a $1\Omega$ [[Resistor]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{P=V_{rms}^2}$$
	  > $P$ = [[Signal Power]] in $W$
	  > $V_{rms}$ = [[Root Mean Square|RMS]] [[Voltage]] in $V$
	- [[Signal Power]] is useful as a standard for measuring and comparing the [[Power]] of different [[Periodic Signal|Periodic Signals]].
