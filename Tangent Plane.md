- ## Definition
	- A [[3D Plane]] whos slope is equal to the rate of change of the target function.
	- Equation for the [[Tangent Plane]] is:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > [[Tangent Plane]] at point $(a,b)$ on $f(x,y)$:
	  > $$\large{z=f(a,b)+f_{x}(a,b)(x-a)+f_{y}(a,b)(y-b)}$$
	  > $\large{0=}$
	  > > [!Warning]
	  > > This equation will give a [[Tangent Plane]] at the point even if one does not exist. The user must check if such a plane exists before using this equation.
	  > > 
	  > > A [[Tangent Plane]] exists at the point $(a,b)$ if the [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] $f_{x}$ and $f_{y}$ exist at $(a,b)$.
