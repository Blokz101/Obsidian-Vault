- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-09-03 18.57.19.excalidraw|400]]
	- A model of the [[Atom]] with a small nuclei in the center consisting of [[Protons]] and [[Neutron]], and [[Electron|Electrons]] orbiting it. When they are packed together there is mostly empty space between them.
- ## Experiment
	- Rutherford shot [[Subatomic Particles]] at a thin sheet of gold and observed that the [[Subatomic Particles|Particles]] deflected in odd ways.
	- Some of the [[Subatomic Particles|Particles]] passed though the sheet, however many deflected at specific angles.
	- He realized that much of the atoms was empty space and it lead him to develop the model of the atom above.
- ## Reference
	- A current model of the [[Atom]].
