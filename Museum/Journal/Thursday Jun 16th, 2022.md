## Progress
**June 16th 2022 - 01:44:57 pm** 
Been working on restructuring my Obsidian Vault, officially clocking in for the day now though.

**June 16th 2022 - 01:49:32 pm** 
Apparently I missed a few modules last time when I was doing the orientation advising thing. Going back and finishing them now. With any luck the advising hold will be lifted then.

**June 16th 2022 - 02:46:12 pm** 
Just finished the rest of the modules. It has not released the hold yet however so I think I will make lunch and then come back to check if it has then. If it has not I will give it 3 days as the website said (for students who had their shit done before June so it may be shorter for me?) before emailing an advisor.

Clocking out for lunch.
