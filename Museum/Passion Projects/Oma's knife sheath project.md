## Goals
- [x] Print and design a working knife sheath for Oma ^b2b637

## Progress
**June 1nd 2022 - 04:32:48 pm** 
Before I printed another sheath I wanted to try the old print one last time. After using a knife to leverage the sheath lock out I was able to grind down the sheath and lock. They now work smoothly so theres no more printing needed.
