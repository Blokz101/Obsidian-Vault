#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The tendency for an [[Atom]] to attract [[Electron|Electrons]] to itself.
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$EN=+\frac{Z_{eff}^2}{n^2}$$
	  > 
	  > $EN$ = [[Electronegativity]] (Units Unknown)
	  > $n$ = [[Principle Quantum Number]] ([[Integer]])
	  > $Z_{eff}$ = [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] (Units Unknown)

- ## Reference
	- [[Effective Nuclear Charge Related Trends]]
	- Directly related to [[Effective Nuclear Charge]], they describe only slightly different things.
	- Has the same equation as [[Ionization Energy]].
	- Has the same equation as [[Energy (Chemistry)]], just negative.
