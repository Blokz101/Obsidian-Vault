- ## Definition
	- 
	- [[Probability]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{NB(x,r,p)=\binom{x+r+1}{r-1}p^r}(1-p)^x$$
		  > 
		  > $B(x,n,p)$ = [[Probability]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
	- [[Expected Value]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{E(X)=\frac{r(1-p)}{p}}$$
		  > 
		  > $E(X)$ [[Expected Value|Expected]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
	- [[Variance]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{V(X)=\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}}$$
		  > 
		  > $V(X)$ = [[Variance]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
