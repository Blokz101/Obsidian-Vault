- ## Definition
	- There is no specific way to describe a [[Poisson Distribution]] random variable. 
	- [[Probability]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{P(x,\mu)=\frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!}}$$
		  > 
		  > $P(x,\mu)$ = [[Probability]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
	- [[Expected Value]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{E(X)=\mu}$$
		  > 
		  > $E(X)$ [[Expected Value|Expected]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
	- [[Variance]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{V(X)=\mu}$$
		  > 
		  > $V(X)$ = [[Variance]] of $x$ trials until $r$ successes have been observed. Trials have $p$ chance of success.
