#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Steps
	1. Break up each compound into its [[Ion|Cation]] and [[Ion|Anion]]
	2. Cross out any [[Ion|Ions]] that never precipitate with anything
		- $Li^+$, $Na^+$, $K^+$, $Rb^+$, $Cs^+$, $Fr^+$, $NH_4^+$, $C_2H_3O_2^-$, $ClO_4^-$, $ClO_3^+$, $NO_3^-$
		- These can be found in [[Solubility Rules]] 1 and 2
	3. Match up the combinations that are left, [[Ion|Cation]] to [[Ion|Anion]], inner and outer.
	4. Decide from the [[Solubility Rules]] which [[Ion|Ions]] form a [[Precipitate]].
	5. Write the [[Net Equation]] for the [[Ion|Ions]] that form a [[Precipitate]].
