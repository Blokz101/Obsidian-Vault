#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The amount of [[Molecule|Molecular]] disorder in a **system**.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\Delta S = \frac{q}{T}$$
	  > 
	  > $\Delta S$ = [[Entropy]]
	  > $T$ = [[Temperature]] in [[Temperature|K]]
	  > $q$ = Heat in J
	- [[Entropy]] is higher in [[Gas|Gases]] then it is in [[Solid|Solids]].
		- This is because in a [[Solid]] the particles are all tightly bound together and so stay in roughly the same configuration, where particles in a [[Gas]] are able to move about freely and so constantly change.
		- Can largely be determined by the [[Mole|Moles]] of [[Gas]] on the **reactant's side** vs  the **product's side**.
- ## Reference
	- Similar to [[Enthalpy]].
