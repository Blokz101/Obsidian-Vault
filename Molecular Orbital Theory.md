#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- One of **two theories** that describes how [[Electron|Electrons]] act in **bonds**.
	- The addition of "waves" in orbitals is either constructive or destructive.
		- Constructive means the two waves amplify each other.
		- Destructive means the two waves cancel each other out.
	- #### Bonding
		- When the "waves" are the same they are constructive and form a **bond**.

	- #### Anti Bonding
		- When the orbitals are the opposites they form a **anti bond** and a [[Node]] between the two.

- ## [[Bond Order]]
	- The [[Bond Order]] can be calculated by:
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$BO=\frac{B-A}{2}$$
	  > 
	  > $BO$ = [[Bond Order]]
	  > $B$ = Number of **bonds**.
	  > $A$ = Number of **anti bonds**.
