#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- One of **two theories** that describes how [[Electron|Electrons]] act in **bonds** of a [[Molecule]].
	- The addition of "waves" in orbitals is either constructive or destructive.
		- Constructive means the two waves amplify each other.
		- Destructive means the two waves cancel each other out.
	- #### Bonding
		- The [[Orbital|Orbitals]] must be on the same plane.
		- When the [[Orbital|Orbitals]] are the same they are constructive and form a **bond**.

	- #### Anti Bonding
		- The [[Orbital|Orbitals]] must be on the same plane.
		- When the [[Orbital|Orbitals]] are the opposites they form a **anti bond** and a [[Node]] between the two.

	- #### Non Bonding
		- When the [[Orbital|Orbitals]] are on totaly different axis they will not interact and therefore cannot form an **anti bond** or **bond**.
- ## Visualizing [[Orbital|Orbitals]]
	- This is what the **n = 2** orbitals look like when ranked by [[Energy]].
		- ![[IMG_F2787B5197D4-1.jpeg]]
		- The **2s** [[Orbital|Orbitals]] are the lowest energy by default and then the **2p**.
		- The **bonds** come first because they are more stable and therefore lower [[Energy]].
		- The **anti sigma bond** is higher in [[Energy]] then the **anti pi bonds**.
- ## Bonding and Anti Bonding
	- If there are more **bonds** then **anti bonds**, then the [[Molecule]] is considered to be **bonding**.
- ## [[Bond Order]]
	- The [[Bond Order]] can be calculated by:
	  - > [!Equation]
	  > $$BO=\frac{B-A}{2}$$
	  > 
	  > $BO$ = [[Bond Order]]
	  > $B$ = Number of **bonds**.
	  > $A$ = Number of **anti bonds**.
	- If there is more then zero **bonds** then the atoms can **bond**, otherwise they wont **bond**.
