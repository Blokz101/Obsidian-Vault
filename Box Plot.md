- ## Definition
	- There are 4 regions that make up the [[Box Plot]]:
		- The [[Interquartile Range]] is shown by a box. The [[Sample Median]] is a line drawn in the middle of this box. 
		- The "max" and "min" range is defined by whiskers sticking out from both sides of the main box.
			- "Min" is $Q1-1.5*IQR$
			- "Max" is $Q_{3}-1.5*IQR$
