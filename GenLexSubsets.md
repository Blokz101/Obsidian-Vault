- ## Definition
	- A method of generating [[Subset|Subsets]] in [[Lexicographic Order]].
	- Takes two [[Natural Number|Natural Numbers]], $r$ and $n$, such that $r \leq n$ and outputs all the $r$-[[Subset|Subsets]] of the [[Set]] $\{ 1,2,\dots,n \}$ in [[Lexicographic Order]].
	- The algorithm to get the next number:
