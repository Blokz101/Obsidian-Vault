- ## Definition
	- The [[Magnetic Field Due to Current|Biot Savart Law]] states that moving [[Charge|Charges]] or [[Current]] generates a [[Magnetic Field]] around a wire.
		- This only works for a **short thin wire** as it is an approximation of sorts.

	  > $I$ = [[Current]] in $A$
	  > $\Delta \vec{l}$ = Position vector from start to end of the wire in the direction of [[Conventional Current]] in $m$
	  > $\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}$ = $1e-7 \frac{Tm^2}{C \frac{m}{s}}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Position from [[Charge]] to observation point in $m$

	- To find the direction of the [[Magnetic Field]] around the wire, you can use the [[Right Hand Rule]] as a short cut.

	  > [!Warning]
	  > This assumes that [[Conventional Current]], if going by the direction that [[Electron|Electrons]] are flowing then the direction of the [[Magnetic Field]] will be opposite of the [[Right Hand Rule]].
	  > 
	  > Also note that if the [[Current]] is negative then it means that [[Current]] is flowing in the opposite direction, account for this when using the [[Right Hand Rule]].
