- ## Definition
	- States that the sum of the currents on a closed loop will always equal 0.
	  > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\sum^{N}_{n=1}I_{n}=0}$$
		  > $N$ = Number of wires at [[Node]]
		  > $n$ = Index of wire at the chosen [[Node]]
		  > $I_{n}$ = [[Current]] of wire at index $n$
	- In other words, current in will always equal current out.
