- ## Definition
	- How much a physical object in physical conditions opposes the flow of [[Electron|Electrons]] though it.
	- [[Resistance]] depends on an objects:
		- Material/[[Resistivity]]
		- Temperature
		- Geometry
		- Light exposure
		- Etc...

	  > $$\large{R=\rho\frac{L}{A}}$$
	  > 
	  > $R$ = [[Resistance]] in $\Omega$
	  > $\rho$ = [[Resistivity]] in $\Omega m$
	  > $L$ = Length in $m$
	  > $A$ = [[Area]] in $m^2$
