#Permanent [[Calculus I]]

- ## Definition
	- A line that touches a single point on a curve and whose slope is equal to that point on the curve.
	- The [[Slope]] pf a [[Tangent Line]] is the [[Secant Line#^7b00b6|equation for the Slope of a Secant Line]] where $h$ approaches $0$.
    > [!Equation]
    > $$m=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
    > 
    > $m$ = [[Slope]]
    > $h$ = The x-axis difference between the two points.
- ## Reference
	- The [[Derivative]] of a [[Function]] reveals the slope of this line at that point.
