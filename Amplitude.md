- ## Definition
	- Distance from [[Average Voltage]] to either max or min peak.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{A=|V_{H}-V_{DC}|}$$
	  > 
	  > $A$ = [[Amplitude]] in $V$
	  > $V_{H}$ = Max [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{DC}$ = [[Average Voltage]] in $V$
	- Also [[Peak to Peak Voltage]] divided by $2$.
	- Notated as $A$ or as $V_{p}$ (Peak [[Voltage]]).
