#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Trends ^eb9b1e
	- #### Note:
		- Most of this can be based off of the fact that $Z_{eff}$ is much greater for [[Electron|Electrons]] close to the [[Nucleus]] then for [[Electron|Electrons]] far away from the [[Nucleus]].
	- #### $Z_{eff}$ Trend for [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]]
		- **$Z_{eff}$ increases as you move from left to right on the [[Periodic Table]]** because there are more [[Proton|Protons]].
		- **$Z_{eff}$ sharply drops as you move the end of one row to the beginning of another** because the new [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Level]] is farther from the [[Nucleus]] and therefore the attraction [[Force]] is weaker.

	- #### [[Atomic Radius]]
		- The [[Atomic Radius]] increases from **right to left and top to bottom**.
		- Because the [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases from **right to left** and as you move down you add more [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Levels]] and therefore there are more [[Electron|Electrons]] farther away from the [[Nucleus]].
		- **See chart below.**
	- #### [[Electronegativity]] and [[Ionization Energy]]
		- Both increase from **left to right and bottom to top**
		- Because the [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases from left to right and top to bottom, it pulls [[Electron|Electrons]] to it more closely. This translates to more energy  to remove an [[Electron]] from orbit, and greater ability pull [[Electron|Electrons]] in.
		- Exception for **[[Electronegativity]]** and [[Noble Gas|Noble Gases]] because [[Noble Gas|Noble Gases]] cannot accept another [[Electron]]. This means that they have a very low [[Electronegativity]] despite a high [[Effective Nuclear Charge]].

	- #### Orbital [[Energy]]
		- Given by this equation located in the [[Bohr's Model]] note:
		  ![[Bohr's Model#^9d1d37]]
		- Increases from **right to left and top to bottom**.
		- Because as [[Effective Nuclear Charge]] increases so does the energy and as the [[Principle Quantum Number|Energy Level]] increases the [[Energy]] decreases because it gets farther from the [[Nucleus]].
		- When comparing [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Sublevel]] [[Energy]] within the same [[Element]], use the [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number]] as a secondary indicator of energy.
