- ## Definition
	- A [[Set]] of [[Set|Sets]] $A$ is [[Pairwise Disjoint]] if the [[Set Intersection|Intersection]] of every pair of [[Set|Sets]] is the [[Empty Set]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > Let the [[Set]] $A$ contain $n$ [[Set|Sets]] $(A_{1}, A_{2},\dots,A_{n})$. They are [[Pairwise Disjoint]] if:
	  > $$\large{A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j}$$
