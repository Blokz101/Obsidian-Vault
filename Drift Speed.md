- ## Definition
	- The average speed at which [[Electron|Electrons]] move inside a wire.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{v_{drift}=\mu E}$$
	  > 
	  > $v_{drift}$ = [[Drift Speed]] in $\frac{m}{s}$
	  > $\mu$ = [[Electron Mobility Constant]] in $\frac{m/s}{v/m}$
	  > $E$ = [[Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
