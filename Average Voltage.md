- ## Definition
	- The average [[Voltage]] over a single [[Period]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V_{DC}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}v(t)  \, dt}$$
	  > $V_{DC}$ = [[Average Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $T$ = [[Period]] in $s$
	  > $v(t)$ = [[Voltage]] function with respect to time in $V$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
