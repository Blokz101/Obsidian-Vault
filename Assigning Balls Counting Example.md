- ## Definition
	- Many counting problems that ask about the number of ways to assign or distribute a set of items can be expressed abstractly by asking about the number of ways to place $n$ balls into $m$ different bins.
	- This is a good example to show the different ways of [[Counting]] based on restrictions.
	- This table shows the number of ways to place $n$ balls into $m$ distinguishable bins based on some restrictions.

		- Note that the bottom right equation is the equation for a [[Permutation]] with repetition where each $\large{n_{x}=\frac{n}{m}}$.
