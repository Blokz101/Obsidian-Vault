- ## Definition
	- A way of representing [[Sinusoidal Signal|Sinusoidal Signals]] in the [[Complex Domain]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}=V_{m}e^{j\theta}}$$
		  > 
		  > $\tilde{V}$ = [[Phasor]] [[Voltage]] in $V$
		  > $V_{m}$ = [[Amplitude]] or Magnitude in $V$
		  > $\theta$ = Phase in degrees/radians
		  > 
		  > See [[Complex Number|Complex Numbers]] for conversions.
		- Note that in the [[Phasor Domain]] there is no time. Therefore [[Sinusoidal Signal|Sinusoidal Signals]] in the [[Complex Domain]] are constant.
