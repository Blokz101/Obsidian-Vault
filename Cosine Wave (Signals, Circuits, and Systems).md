- ## Definition
	- A [[Periodic Signal]] in the form of:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$V(t)=V_{DC}+V_{p}\cos(2\pi ft+\theta)$$
	  > $V(t)$ = [[Voltage]] in terms of time in $V$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $V_{DC}$ = [[Average Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{p}$ = [[Amplitude]] in $V$
	  > $f$ = [[Frequency]] in $\frac{1}{s}$
	  > $\theta$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]] in $s$ ^6b129b
