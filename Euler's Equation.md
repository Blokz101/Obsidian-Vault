- ## Definition
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{e^{j\theta}=\cos(\theta)+j\sin(\theta)}$$
	  > With some rearranging we can also find Euler's Identities:
	  > $$\large{e^{j\pi/2}=j}$$
	  > $$\large{e^{j\pi}=-1}$$
	  > $$\large{e^{j2\pi}=1}$$
	  > $$\large{\cos(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}(e^{j\theta}+e^{-j\theta})}$$
	  > $$\large{\sin(\theta)=\frac{1}{2}(e^{j\theta}-e^{-j\theta})}$$
