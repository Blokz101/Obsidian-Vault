	- Uses **negative logic**:
		- One [[OR Gate]] for each **0** output.

	- To create a logic circuit that will output the given truth table using [[Product of Sums]], focus on the **0** outputs. Place one [[OR Gate]] for each series of inputs that yields a **0**.
		- For example, for first **0** output, you would want the [[OR Gate]] to activate at all times except when **A and B and C**. So add an [[OR Gate]] for those series of inputs.
