#### Projection Theory

Order:
1. Observer
2. Plane of projection
3. Object

Projection Types:
- Parallel Projection is what we see most of the time in solidworks, all lines of projection are parallel
- Perspective is what we see in real life, all lines of projection converge at the eyeball

Projection Methods:
- Trimetric: All three angles are unequal
- Dimetric: Two angles are the same and the other is something else
- Isometric: All angles are the same

Oblique Sketches: The Front face is true, and all the other lines on the depth axis are at a 45 degree angle

Angle Type Projections

Third Angle Projection
- The cone is the third symbol and the circle is the second
- Used by the US

First Angle Projection
- The cone is the first symbol and the circle is the second
- Used by other places
