- ## Definition
	- [[Periodic Table Image.png|Chart]] of [[Element|Elements]]
	  ![[Periodic Table Image.png]]
	- Arranged by the number of [[Subatomic Particles]] in their [[Atom|Atoms]] and by their properties.
	- Periods are rows, there are 7 periods.
	- Groups/Families are columns, there are 18 groups.
- ## Periodic Table Entry
	- #### Standard
		- ![[Periodic Table Entry Screenshot.png]]
		- The symbol in the middle identifies the [[Element]].
		- The [[Atomic Number]] tells you how many [[Proton|Protons]] there are in an [[Atom]] of a given [[Element]].
		- The [[Molar Mass]] or [[Molar Mass|Average Atomic Mass]]
	- #### Other
		- Might also see [[Element|Elements]] notated like this:
		  $$\large{^{56}_{26}Fe}$$
		  The top number is the [[Mass Number]] while the bottom number is the [[Atomic number]].
- ## Reactivity and Properties 
	- [[Element|Elements]] with less [[Electron|Electrons]] in their outermost shell are more reactive.
	- Reactivity goes from the top-right (most stable, least reactive) to the bottom-left (least stable, more reactive).
	- Elements have similar chemical properties when they have the same number of [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]].
- ## [[Metal|Metals]] vs [[Non-Metal|Non-Metals]]
	- [[Metal|Metals]] are generally on the left $2/3$s of the table.
	- [[Metalloid|Metalloids]] are on a diagonal line running from approximately B to At.
	- [[Non-Metal|Non-Metals]] are on the other side of the line.
- ## Reference
	- [[Mass Number]] deals with information directly from this table.
