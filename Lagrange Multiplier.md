- ## Definition
	- A method of finding the [[Global Optimization|Absolute Extrema]] for a function bounded by another function.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Let $f$ the function to be [[Global Optimization|Optimized]] constrained by $g$
	  > $$\large{\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g}$$
	  > Which splits into a system of equations given by the equation above and $g(x,y,z)=0$:
	  > $$\large{f_{x}=\lambda g_{x}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{y}=\lambda g_{y}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{z}=\lambda g_{z}}$$
	  > $$\large{0=g(x,y,z)}$$
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > This system of solves for many points which will be the **extrema**. 
	  > > 
	  > > When solving, make sure to account for variables having "special states". Separate cases must be made for each variable if it equals 0
	  > > 
	  > > Solving for things such as **square roots** and **multiplying factors that equal 0** ( Ex: $x(4x-2)=0$ ) are a few ways that the system of equations will split into many **points of interest**.
