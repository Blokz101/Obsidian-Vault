- ## Definition
	- A method of finding the [[Global Optimization|Absolute Extrema]] for a function bounded by another function.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Let $f$ the function to be [[Global Optimization|Optimized]] constrained by $g$
	  > $$\large{\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g}$$
	  > Which splits into a system of equations:
	  > $$\large{f_{x}=\lambda g_{x}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{y}=\lambda g_{y}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{z}=\lambda g_{z}}$$
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > This system of solves for many points which will be the **extrema**. When solving things such as **square roots** and **multiplying factors that equal 0**( Ex: $x(4x-2)=0$ )
