- ## Definition
	- A method of finding the [[Global Optimization|Absolute Extrema]] for a function bounded by another function.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > Let $f$ the function to be [[Global Optimization|Optimized]] constrained by $g$
	  > $$\large{\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g}$$
	  > Which splits into a system of equations:
	  > $$\large{f_{x}=\lambda g_{x}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{y}=\lambda g_{y}}$$
	  > $$\large{f_{z}=\lambda g_{z}}$$
	  > Solve this system to
