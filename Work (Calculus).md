- ## Definition
	- The [[Energy]] transferred to or from an object via the application of [[Force]] along a [[Displacement]].
	- When **[[Force]] is constant** over a [[Displacement]] then [[Work (Calculus)]] can be given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $W=F*D$
		  > 
		  > $W$ = [[Work (Calculus)]]
		  > $F$ = [[Force]]
		  > $D$ = [[Displacement]]
	- However when the **[[Force]] is variable but [[Continuity|Continuous]]** over a [[Displacement]] then [[Work (Calculus)]] is given by:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $W = \lim_{ n \to \infty }\sum^{n}_{i=1}$
