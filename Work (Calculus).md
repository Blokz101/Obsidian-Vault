- ## Definition
	- The [[Energy]] transferred to or from an object via the application of [[Force]] along a [[Displacement]].
	When [[Force]] is constant over [[Displacement]] then [[Work (Calculus)]]
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $W=F*D$
	  > 
	  > $W$ = [[Work (Calculus)]]
	  > $F$ = [[Force]]
	  > $D$ = [[Displacement]]
