## Definition
The length of an arc or curved line. For example, the length of $f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$. 
There are three versions based on what arc your dealing with:
- Function of X
- Function of Y
- Parabolic

##### Function of X
Where the curve we are measuring is a function of $x$.

> $$\text{Arc Length}=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 } \, dx$$

##### Function of Y
Where the curve we are measuring is a function of $y$
