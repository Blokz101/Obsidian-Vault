- ## Definition
	- The length of an arc or curved line. For example, the length of $f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$. 
	- There are three versions based on what arc your dealing with:
		- Function of X
		- Function of Y
		- [[Parametric Function]]
- ##### Function of X
	- Where the curve we are measuring is a function of $x$.

	- [[Arc Length Proof]]
	- > [!Equation]
          > $$\text{Arc Length}=\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2 } \, dx$$
- ##### Function of Y
	- Where the curve we are measuring is a function of $y$

	- The proof is roughly the same as for the **Function of X**, but $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is flipped and t

	  > $\int_{c}^{d} \sqrt{ 1+\left( \frac{dx}{dy} \right)^{2} } \, dy$
