- ## Definition
	- Involves a literal tank of some solution whose composition is altered by the introduction of another solution entering the tank. The thoroughly mixed solution exits the tank at some rate. The tank might actually be a room of a building, a lake of relatively fixed volume, or the human body; but the concepts are the same in each case.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$A'(t)=\left( c_{\text{in}}*r_{\text{in/out}} \right)-\left( \frac{A(t)}{k} *r_{\text{in/out}}\right)$$
	  > 
	  > $A(t)$ = Amount of substance dissolved in the tank
	  > $c_{\text{in}}$ = Concentration of substance being added
	  > $r_{\text{in/out}}$ = Rate of liquid being added and removed
	  > $k$ = Capacity of the tank
	  > 
	  > > [!Proof]
	  > > $A(t)$ is the amount of substance dissolved in the tank. $A'(t)$ is the rate of change of substance dissolved in the tank. Some liquid drains at the same rate that it enters so:
	  > > $$A'(t)=(\text{rate of A in})-(\text{rate of A out})$$
	  > > The $\text{rate of A in/out}$ will be the concentration of the liquid entering/exiting the tank multiplied by the rate at which it is entering/exiting.
	  > > $$\text{Rate of A in/out}=(\text{Concentration of A in/out})(\text{Rate of mixture in/out})$$
	  > > Finally the $\text{Concentration of A in/out}$ is the amount of substance dissolved in the tank divided by the capacity of liquid that the tank can hold.
	  > > $$\text{concentration}=\frac{A(t)}{\text{capacity}}$$
	  > > Putting it all together:
	  > > $$A'(t)=\left( c_{\text{in}}*r_{\text{in/out}} \right)-\left( \frac{A(t)}{k} *r_{\text{in/out}}\right)$$
