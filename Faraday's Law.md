- ## Definition
	- A [[Non Coulomb Electric Field]] can create a [[Current]]:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V_{\text{induced}}=-\frac{d\Phi_{\text{magnetic}}}{dt}}$$
	  > 
	  > $V_{\text{induced}}$ = [[Voltage]] induced by the [[Magnetic Flux]] in $V$
	  > $\Phi_{\text{magnetic}}$ = [[Magnetic Flux]] in $Tm^2$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
