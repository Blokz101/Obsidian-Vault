- ## Definition
	- A [[Non Coulomb Electric Field]] can create a [[Current]]:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{emf_{\text{induced}}=-\frac{d\Phi_{\text{magnetic}}}{dt}}$$
	  > 
	  > 
	  > $emf_{\text{induced}}$ = [[emf]] by the [[Magnetic Flux]] in $V$
	  > $\Phi_{\text{magnetic}}$ = [[Magnetic Flux]] in $Tm^2$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
	  
	  > [!Equation]
	  > After substituting with [[Voltage]]/[[Electromotive Force|emf]] and [[Magnetic Flux]] over a closed loop:
	  > $$\large{\oint\vec{E}_{NC}\cdot d\vec{r}=-\frac{d}{dt}\int \vec{B}\cdot \hat{n} \, dA}$$
	  > $\vec{n}$ = [[Normal Vector]] to the loop in $m$
	  > $\vec{B}$ = [[Magnetic Field]] though the loop in $T$
	  > $\vec{E}_{NC}$ = [[Non Coulomb Electric Field]] in $\frac{N}{C}$
	  > $\vec{r}$ = Change in position along a closed loop in $m$
	  > $A$ = Area of the loop in $m^2$
	  > $t$ = Time in $s$
