- ## Definition
	- The force that directly opposes motion.
	- Visualized with the [[Spring and Ball Model]]:

	- There are two types of [[Friction Force|Friction]]:
		- Static Friction
			- The force that opposes motion when the **object is at rest**.
			- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{F_{\text{static}}\leq\mu_{s}F_{N}}$$
			  > 
			  > $F_{\text{static}}$ = [[Friction Force|Static Friction]] force in $N$
			  > $\mu_{s}$ = [[Friction Force|Static Friction]] Coefficient
			  > $F_{n}$ = [[Normal Force]] in $N$
		- Kinetic Friction
			- The force that opposes motion when the **object is in motion**.
			- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\large{F_{\text{kinetic}}\approx\mu_{k}F_{N}}$$
			  > 
			  > $F_{\text{kinetic}}$ = [[Friction Force|Static Friction]] force in $N$
			  > $\mu_{k}$ = [[Friction Force|Static Friction]] Coefficient
			  > $F_{n}$ = [[Normal Force]] in $N$
