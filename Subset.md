- ## Definition
	- A [[Set]] where every element in that set is in another set.
	- If every element in $A$ is also an element of $B$ then "$A$ is a subset of $B$".
	- Notated with $\subseteq$ if the set and subset can be equal or $\subset$ if they cannot.
	  > [!Example]
	  > $A=\{ 3,4,5 \}$
	  > $B=\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$
	  > Therefore:
	  > $A\subseteq B$
