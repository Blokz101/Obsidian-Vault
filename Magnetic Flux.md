- ## Definition
	- Given by [[Magnetic Flux|Ampere's Law]]:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l}=\mu_{0}I_{\text{inside}}}$$
	  > 
	  > $\vec{B}$ = [[Magnetic Field]] along the path of the [[Amperian Loop]] in $T$
	  > $\vec{l}$ = [[Vector]] path along the [[Amperian Loop]] in $m$
	  > $\mu_{0}$ = $4\pi *10^{-12}\, \frac{Tm}{A}$
	  > $I_{\text{inside}}$ = [[Current]] flowing inside the [[Amperian Loop]] in $A$
