- ## Definition
	- In many biological systems the resources are finite and hence the population will not grow without bound. The logistic growth model serves us as a better population growth model for the long term since it accounts for having finite resources. In this model, the growth begins at a nearly-exponential rate, but due to various constraints, it eventually approaches its carrying capacity (limiting value).
