- ## Definition
	- Formula to expand a binomial equation raised to a high power
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{(x+y)^2=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(_k^n)x^{n-k}y^k}$$
	  > $x$ and $y$ = Random placeholder terms
	  > $n$ = Max Index
	  > $k$ = Index
	  > $(_k^n)$ = Binomial Coefficient of Each Term in [[Subset|n Choose r]] format
