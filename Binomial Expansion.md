- ## Definition
	- Formula to expand a binomial equation raised to a high power
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{(x+y)^2=\sum_{k=0}^{n}(_k^n)x^{n-k}y^k}$$
	  > $x$ and $y$ = Random placeholder terms
	  > $n$ = Max Index
	  > $k$ = Index
	  > $(_k^n)$ = Binomial Coefficient of Each Term
	- This link explains it better then I currently care to: mathsisfun.com/algebra/binomial-theorem.html
- ## Reference
	- Uses [[Pascal's Triangle]].
