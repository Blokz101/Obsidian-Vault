- ## Definition
	- A [[Negative Binomial Distribution]] random variable $X$ is
	- Requirements:
		- The experiment consists of a sequence of independent trials.
		- E
	- [[Hypergeometric Distribution]] and [[Negative Binomial Distribution]]
	  > The binomial distribution is the approximate probability model for sampling without replacement from a finite boolean (each individual is either a success or failure) population provided the sample size $n$ is small relative to the population size $N$; the hypergeometric distribution is the exact probability model for the number of successes in the sample.
