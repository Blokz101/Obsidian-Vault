- ## Definition
	- The [[Derivative]] of a [[Multi-Variable Function]] where all but one variable are held constant.
	- [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] can be notated like this:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > The [[Partial Derivative]] of $f(x,y,z)$ with respect to $x$ is:
	  > $$\large{\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x }f(x,y,z)}$$
	- [[Partial Derivative]] can be chained together. When done so they are notated like this:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > The [[Partial Derivative]] of $f(x,y,z)$ with respect to $y$, then $x$, then $z$ is:
	  > $$\frac{ \partial  }{ \partial z }\left( \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial x }\left( \frac{ \partial  }{ \partial y }f(x,y,z) \right) \right)=\large{f_{yxz}(x,y,z)}$$
	- The order of [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] is important and can change the answer for each [[Partial Derivative]]. However, if the the [[Multi-Variable Function]] is [[Continuity|Continuous]] then the order of the [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] does not matter.
		- This is very useful for [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] that are hard to solve in a specific order. Another different order of the same [[Partial Derivative|Partial Derivatives]] might be able to work in its place.
