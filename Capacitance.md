- ## Definition
	- The extent to which a material can store [[Charge]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{C=\epsilon\frac{A}{d}}$$
	  > 
	  > $C$ = [[Capacitance]] in $C$
	  >  $A$ = Area of plates in the drawing below in $m^2$
	  >  $d$ = Distance as shown in the drawing below in $m$
	  >  $\epsilon$ = Some efficiency constant
	- Depends on the material and geometry of that material.
