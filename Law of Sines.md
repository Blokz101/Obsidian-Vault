- ## Definition
	- An equation that relates the sides of a triangle to their angles.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\frac{sin(A)}{a}=\frac{sin(B)}{b}=\frac{sin(C)}{c}}$$
	  > $A$ = Angle $A$
	  > $a$ = Length of side $a$
	  > $B$ = Angle $B$
	  > $b$ = Length of side $b$
	  > $C$ = Angle $C$
	  > $c$ = Length of side $c$
