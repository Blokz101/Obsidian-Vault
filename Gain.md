- ## Definition
	- The ratio between the input and output [[Voltage]] of an [[Electrical Component]], generally an [[Amplifier]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{A_{v}=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}}$$
	  > 
	  > $A_{v}$ = [[Gain]] in $dB$
	  > $V_{in}$ = The input [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{out}$ = The output [[Voltage]] in $V$
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{G=20\log(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}})}$$
	  > 
	  > $G$ = [[Power]] [[Gain]] in $dB$
	  > $V_{in}$ = The input [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{out}$ = The output [[Voltage]] in $V$
