- ## Definition
	- The ratio between the input and output [[Voltage]] of an [[Electrical Component]], generally an [[Amplifier]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{A_{v}=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}}$$
	  > 
	  > $A_{v}$ = [[Gain]]
	  > $V_{in}$ = The input [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{out}$ = The output [[Voltage]] in $V$
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{G=10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \right)}$$
	  > or in [[Voltage|Volts]]:
	  > $$\large{G=20\log_{10}(\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}})}$$
	  > 
	  > $G$ = [[Power]] [[Gain]] in $dB$
	  > $P_{in}$ = Input [[Power]] in $W$
	  > $P_{out}$ = Output [[Power]] in $W$
	  > $V_{in}$ = Input [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{out}$ = Output [[Voltage]] in $V$
	  > 
	  > > [!Note]
	  > > Note that the [[Power]] version of [[Gain]] can also be expressed in [[Decibel Watt|Decibel Watts]] like this:
	  > > $$\large{G=10\log_{10}(P_{[W]out})-10\log_{10}(P_{[W]in})=P_{[dBW]out}-P_{[dBW]in}}$$
