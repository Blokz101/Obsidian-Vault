- ## Definition
	- Work is the process of adding or removing [[Energy (Physics)]] from a **system**.
	- When the acting **force** is **constant** we can define [[Work (Physics)]] like this:
		- > [!Equation]
		> $$\large{\begin{align}
		W & =\vec{F}*\Delta \vec{r} \\
	 & = |\vec{F}|*|\Delta \vec{r}|*\cos(\theta) \\
	 & =F_{x}\Delta r_{x}+F_{y}\Delta r_{y}+F_{z}\Delta r_{z}
		\end{align}}$$
		>
		> $W$ = Work in $J$
		> $\vec{F}$ = Force in $N$
		> $\Delta \vec{r}$ = Displacement in $m$
	- When the acting **force** is **variable** we have to [[Integral|Integrate]] to find [[Work (Physics)].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{W=\int_{i}^{f} \vec{F} \, d\vec{r}}$$
		  > 
		  > $W$ = Work in $J$
		  > $\vec{F}$ = Force in $N$
		  > $\Delta \vec{r}$ = Displacement in $m$
	- Positive [[Work (Physics)]] means that [[Energy (Physics)]] is being **added to a system**.
	- Negative [[Work (Physics)]] means that [[Energy (Physics)]] is being **removed from a system**.
