- ## Definition
	- States that any linear two terminal [[Electrical Circuit]] can be replaced with a circuit containing just a [[Current Source]] and [[Resistor]] in parallel.![[Screenshot 2024-01-26 at 4.08.57â€¯PM.png]]
	- There are two main values that need to be found: $R_{N}$ and $I_{N}$.
- #### Finding $I_{N}$
	- Simply [[Short Circuit]] the two terminals together and calculate the [[Current]] flowing though the short.
