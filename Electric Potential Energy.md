- ## Definition
	- Similar to [[Gravitational Force]] except this time the "masses" can both repel and attract each other depending on their **charge**.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{U_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r}}$$
	  > 
	  > $U_{e}$ = [[Electric Potential Energy]] in $C$
	  > $Q_{1/2}$ = Charge
	  > $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$ = $9e9\frac{Nm^2}{c^2}$
	  > $r$ = Separation in $m$
	  > 
	  > The proof is the exact same as for [[Gravitational Potential Energy]] but with $F_{g}$ substituted for $F_{e}$ from [[Electromagnetic Force]].
