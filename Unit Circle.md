		- $sin$ refers to the $y$ values of the coordinates and $cos$ refers to the $x$ values for the coordinates.
		  > [!Memory Aid]
		  > Coordinates:
		  > - The $x$ values go $3$, $2$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $3$ with all $2$ and $3$ values under a square root
		  > - The $y$ values go $1$, $2$, $3$, $3$, $2$, $1$ with all $2$ and $3$ values under a square root
		  > - Use knowledge of quadrants to determine negative 
		  > 
		  > Radians:
		  > - The denominators go 6, 4, 3, 3, 4, 6, all the way around.
		  > - Numerators:
		  >   - Quadrant 1: All are simply $\pi$
		  >   - Quadrant 2: Simply $1-denominator$
		  >   - Quadrant 3: Simply $1+denominator$
		  >   -Quadrant 4: Is $denominator*2-1$
		  >   
		  >   Degrees:
		  >   - Increase by 30, 15, 15, 30 all the way around.
