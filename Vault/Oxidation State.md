#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The hypothetical [[Charge]] of an [[Atom]] if all of its bonds to different atoms were [[Ionic Bond]].
	- In general a main group [[Element|Element's]] [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] will range from: **the group of the [[Element]] to the group of the [[Element]] minus 8**.
		- > [!Example]-
		> $Cl$ is in group $7A$:
		> 
		> Therefore its [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] can range from:
		> $7$ to $-1$
- In general a transition [[Element|Element's]] [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] will be $2+$.
	- Due to a loss of two [[Electron|Electrons]] in its $s$ [[Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number|Sublevel]].
- ## THE MAIN RULES
	- #### Rule 1
		- The [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of atoms in their **Elemental Form** is $0$.
			- Example: $Fe$, $S_8$, $O_2$
	- #### Rule 2
		- $F$ or Fluorine is always assigned an [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of $-1$ due to its high [[Electronegativity|Electronegativity]].
			- Except if **Rule 1 applies**.
	- #### Rule 3
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of Group 1A is always $+1$.
		- [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Number]] of Group 
	- #### Rule 4
	- #### Rule 5
