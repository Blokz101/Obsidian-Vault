#Permanent [[Chemistry]] [[Compound]]

- ## Definition
	- A [[Compound]] between a [[Metal]] and a [[Non-Metal]]. The [[Atoms]] form an [[Ionic Bond]] as the [[Metal]] **gives away** its [[Electron|Electrons]] with the [[Non-Metal]].
		- [[Ionic Compound#^ed6c41|This is the reason that the atoms stick together]].
	  >[!Memory Aid]
	  >Its Ironic that Metals and Non-Metals get together.
- ## Effects of the [[Ionic Bond]]
	- The [[Metal|Metals]] become [[Ion|Cations]] as they give up [[Electron|Electrons]].
		- They also get **smaller**.
	- The [[Non-Metal|Non-Metals]] before [[Ion|Anions]] as they gain [[Electron|Electrons]].
		- They get **larger**.
	- The [[Metal|Metals]] and [[Non-Metal|Non-Metals]] become attracted to each other because of the difference in their charges (one negative and one positive). ^ed6c41
- ## Names
	- To find the name for an [[Ionic Compound]] you need to first predict the ratio in which the [[Atom|Atoms]] in the [[Ionic Compound]] will combine in.
		1. Determine the [[Charge]] on each of the [[Ion|Ions]]
		2. Predict the ratio in which they will combine
		3. The names are simply combinations of the individual [[Ion|Ions]]
	- > [!Example]
	    > Write the formula and name of the compound made from calcium and nitrogen.
	    > 1. Calcium is in Group 2, so its [[Ion|Cation]] will have a 2+ charge
	    > 2. Nitrogen is in group 15, so its [[Ion|Anion]] will have a 3- charge
	    > 3. We can determine that the ratio of Calcium to Nitrogen to make the charges cancel out will be three Calcium for a charge of 6+ and two Nitrogen for a charge of 6-. Together they have a charge of 0.
	    > 4. The final formula is $Ca_3N_2$ and the name is Calcium Nitride
- ## Other Notes
	- [[Compound|Compounds]] made from [[Monoatomic Ion|Monoatomic Ions]] are often referred to as [[Binary Compound|Binary Compounds]]
	  > [!Warning]
	  > [[Ionic Compound|Ionic Compounds]] **DO NOT FORM** [[Molecule|Molecules]], they are instead referred to as "Formula Units".
