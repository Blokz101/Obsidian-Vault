- ### Domain and Range
	- [[Domain]] and [[Range]]
	- The function is undefined anywhere the denominator is equal to 0 or if there is the even root of a negative number.
- ### Functions
	- [[Function]]
	- $(f\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$
	- [[One to One]] means a function where each y value points to a **unique** x value.
- ### Increasing and Decreasing
	- Determined by the derivative of a function. If the derivative is positive then the function is increasing and if it is negative then the function is decreasing.
- ### Asymptotes
	- [[Asymptote]]
	- Can find the vertical ones by setting the  to 0 and solving for its roots.
	- Can find the horizontal ones by looking at the largest exponent, more in the [[Asymptote|Asymptotes]] note.
