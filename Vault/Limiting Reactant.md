#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A reactant required for a [[Chemical Reaction]] that limits the reaction due to its scarcity. 
	  > [!Example]
	  > When you are driving a car there are many factors that go into making the car drive. Gas, tire wear, oil, etc. If you have very little gas, new tires, and full oil then the limiting factor would be gas because it will run out first and stop you from driving.
- ## Finding the [[Limiting Reactant]] in a [[Balanced Equation]]
	1. List the [[Mole|Moles]] of each [[Reactant]] required.
	2. For the first [[Reactant]], use the [[Balanced Equation]] to create a [[Conversion Factor]] to calculate how much of the other [[Reactant|Reactants]] would be required to fully react with the selected [[Reactant]].
	3. Which ever [[Reactant]] is lower then its given supply is the [[Limiting Reactant]] 
	   
	   > [!Example]
	   > $$CH_4+2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2+2H_2O$$
	   > **When 13.78 moles of $CH_4$Â react with 27.28 moles of $O_2$, what is the limiting reactant?**
	   > $13.78moleCH_4*\frac{2moleO_2}{1moleCH_4}=27.56moleO_2$
	   > This tells us that $27.56moleO_2$ is required to fully exhaust the supply of  $13.78moleCH_4$. Because this is more than the amount of $O_2$ provided we know that $O_2$ is the limiting reactant.
