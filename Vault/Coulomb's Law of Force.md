- ## Definition
	- Equation that states that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{Ɛr^2}}$$
	  > $F$ = Force in [[Newtons]]
	  > $k$ = [[Coulomb's Constant]] = ($8.9875e9\frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$)
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] (Coulombs)
	  > $Ɛ$ = [[Dielectric Constant]]
	  > $r$ = Distance
	- When the [[Charge|Charges]] of two particles are both positive or both negative the force is **positive and repulsive**
	- When one particle is positively [[Charge|Charged]] and one is negatively [[Charge|Charged]], the force is **negative and attractive**.
	- The [[Force]] is the strongest when dealing with two large [[Charge|Charges]] and the atoms are close together.
- ## Reference
	- Strongly related to [[Coulomb's Law of Energy]].
