#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Derived from [[Coulomb's Law of Force]]. States that the electric force of one charge on another depends on the magnitude of the [[Charge|Charges]] and the distance between them.

	  > $\large{F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{Ɛr^2}}$
	  > 
	  > [[Energy]]:
	  > $E=rF$
	  > 
	  > Therefore:
	  > $\large{r*F=\frac{kq_1q_2}{Ɛr}}$ (Multiply by $r$)
	  > $\large{E=\frac{kq_1q_2}{Ɛr}}$ (Substitute in [[Energy]])
	  
  - > [!Warning]
	  > I have no clue why or how radius multiplied by force gives energy, be careful interpreting information from that process.

	  > $E$ = [[Energy]]
	  > $k$ = [[Coulomb's Constant]] = ($8.9875e9\frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$)
	  > $q$ = [[Charge]] (Coulombs)
	  > $Ɛ$ = [[Dielectric Constant]]
	  > $r$ = Distance
	  > 
	- Same as [[Coulomb's Law of Force]], the more **negative the [[Energy]], the more attractive**, and **the more positive, the more repulsive**.
