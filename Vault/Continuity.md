#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- A [[Function]] is a [[Continuity|Continuous]] for its [[Domain]] if it can be sketched without the need to left your pencil.
	- If the [[Limit|Right Hand Limit]], [[Limit|Left Hand Limit]], and function itself are defined at an $x$ then the function is continuous at that $x$.
