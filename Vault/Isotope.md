#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- [[Atom|Atoms]] of the same [[Element]] but with different [[Mass Number|Mass Numbers]].
	- Notated with a box with the symbol of the [[Element]] in the middle. On the north-west side is the [[Mass Number]] and on the south-west side is the [[Atomic Number]] or number of [[Proton|Protons]].

- ## [[Isotope]] vs [[Ion]]
	- The main difference is that an [[Ion]] is created by gaining or loosing [[Electron|Electrons]] and an [[Isotope]] is define by its number of [[Neutron|Neutrons]]. An [[Isotope]] can also be an [[Ion]] if it gains a [[Charge]]. ^2b6aa8
- ## Reference
	- [[Molar Mass|Atomic Mass]] is calculated with a weighted average of the weight of its [[Isotope|Isotopes]].
	- Defined by its number of [[Neutron|Neutrons]].
	- If it is given a charge it will be an [[Isotope]] and an [[Ion]].
