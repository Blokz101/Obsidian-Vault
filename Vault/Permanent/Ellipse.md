#Permanent [[Calculus]] [[Conic Section]]

- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-08-24 13.34.27.excalidraw|150]]
	- Normally a > b, however if a â‰¯ b then the [[Ellipse]] is a [[Circle]].
	- Orientation
		- You can tell the orientation by looking at which variable(x or y) is over the denominator $a^2$. **If y is over $a^2$ then it is vertical** and if **x is over $a^2$ then it is horizontal**.
		  > [!Warning]
		  > This is true because, as stated above, a > b normally. If the [[Ellipse]] is a [[Circle]] orientation does not matter.
		- Vertical
			- $\large{\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}=1}$
		- Horizontal
			- $\large{\frac{(x-k)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-h)^2}{b^2}=1}$
	- You can identify a [[Ellipse]] by the fact that the two fractions that contain x and y are both positive and both x and y are squared. In an [[Hyperbola]] one of the fractions will be negative.
- ## Reference
	- Equation is exactly the same as an [[Hyperbola]] except for the negative.
