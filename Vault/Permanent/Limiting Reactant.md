#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- A reactant required for a [[Chemical Reaction]] that limits the reaction due to its scarcity. 
	  > [!Example]
	  > When you are driving a car there are many factors that go into making the car drive. Gas, tire wear, oil, etc. If you have very little gas, new tires, and full oil then the limiting factor would be gas because it will run out first and stop you from driving.
- ## Finding the [[Limiting Reactant]] in a [[Balanced Equation]]
	1. List the [[Mole|Moles]] of each [[Reactant]] required.
	2. For each [[Reactant]] find use the [[Balanced Equation]] to calculate how many [[Moles]] of [[Product]] it could produce given an infinite amount of the other [[Reactant|Reactants]].
	3. The [[Reactant]] that can produce the least amount of [[Mole|Moles]] of [[Product]] is the [[Limiting Reactant]]
	   
	   > [!Example]
	   > $$CH_4+2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2+2H_2O$$
	   > **When 4 moles of $CH_4$Â react with 10 moles of $O_2$, what is the limiting reactant?**
	   > $1moleCH_4*\frac{}{}$
	   > $2moleO_2$
