- ## Definition
	- The process of adding [[Solvent]] only to a [[Solution]].
- ## How to calculate
	- We know that the amount of [[Solute]] will remain constant and only the amount of [[Solvent]] and [[Molarity]] will change. Using this we can relate the before dilution and after dilution equations together using
