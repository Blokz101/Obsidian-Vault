#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The process of adding [[Solvent]] only to a [[Solution]].
- ## How to calculate
	- We know that the [[Mole|Moles]] of [[Solute]] will remain constant and only the [[Volume]] of the [[Solution]] and [[Molarity]] will change. We can eliminate [[Mole|Moles]] of [[Solute]] from the equation by substitution and relate the final and initial [[Solution|Solutions]] to each other.

	  > $$m_i=m_f$$
	  > $$m=MV$$
	  > $$M_iV_i=M_fV_f$$
	  > This equation relates the [[Molarity]] and [[Volume]] of the initial [[Solution]] to the same for the final [[Solution]].
