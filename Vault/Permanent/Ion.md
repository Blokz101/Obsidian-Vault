#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- Note
	- **[[Ion|Ions]] are always [[Charge|charged]], never neutral**
		- Positively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Cations]] while negatively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Anions]]. If it is neutral it is an [[Atom]]
		- The number of [[Proton|Protons]] in an [[Ion]] is constant, however [[Electron|Electrons]] can be added or removed. Given the [[Element]] and charge you can determine the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] the [[Ion]] has
		  > [!Example]
		  > $$Cl_{1-}$$
		  > Cl is element #17 so it will have 17 [[Proton|Protons]], to give it a charge of $1-$ it will have to have 18 [[Electron|Electrons]].
	- There are two types:
		- [[Monoatomic Ion]] 
		- [[Polyatomic Ions]]
	- An [[Ion|Ions]] charge always appears as subscript to its [[Ion]]. Ex $Fe^{3+}$, $Cl^{1-}$, $NH_4^{1+}$, $SO_4^{2-}$.
