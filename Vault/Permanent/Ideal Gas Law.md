#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The equation that relates the laws of an [[Ideal Gas]] together.
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$PV=nRT$$
	  > $P$ = [[Pressure]] in atm
	  > $V$ = [[Volume]] in L
	  > $n$ = The number of [[Mole|Moles]]
	  > $R$ = The [[Ideal Gas]] constant is **0.0821** $\frac{L-atm}{K-mol}$
	  > $T$ = Temperature in K
- ## Notes
	- $R$ is always known, we only need to solve for the other three.
