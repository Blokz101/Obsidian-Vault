#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- Definition
	- A group of [[Atom|Atoms]] connected by [[Chemical Bond|Chemical Bonds]].
	- They represent the smallest fundamental unit of [[Compound|Compounds]] that can take part in a chemical reaction.
- Notation
	- A [[Molecule]] is denoted by the presence of more than one [[Atom]], such as $HCl$, $O_2$, $P_4$, or $C_6H_{12}O_6$.
	- The first two [[Molecule|Molecules]] contain two [[Atom|Atoms]], whereas $P_4$ contains four [[Atom|Atoms]], and $C_6H_{12}O_6$ contains 24 [[Atom|Atoms]].
	  >[!Note]
	  >Notice that two of these are [[Element|Elements]] and two are [[Compound|Compounds]]. A [[Molecule]] does not make a difference between the two.
