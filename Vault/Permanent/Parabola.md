- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-08-24 13.20.24.excalidraw|150]]
	- Orientation
		- You can tell the [[Parabola]] is vertical or horizontal by looking at the variable(either x or y) that is not squared. If y is not squared it is vertical and if x is not squared it is horizontal.
		- Vertical
			- $y-k=a(x-h)^2$
		- Horizontal
			- $x-h=a(y-k)^2$
	- You can identify a [[Parabola]] by the fact that one of the two variables x or y is not squared. Both [[Hyperbola|Hyperbolas]] and [[Ellipse|Ellipses]] have both x and y squared in their equations.
- ## Reference
	- Is a type of [[Conic Section]]
