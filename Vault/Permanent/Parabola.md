	- Orientation
		- You can tell the orientation by looking at the variable(x or y) that is not squared. If **y is not squared then it is vertical** and if **x is not squared then it is horizontal**.
		- Vertical
			- $y-k=a(x-h)^2$
		- Horizontal
			- $x-h=a(y-k)^2$
	- You can identify a [[Parabola]] by the fact that one of the two variables x or y is not squared. Both [[Hyperbola|Hyperbolas]] and [[Ellipse|Ellipses]] have both x and y squared in their equations.
