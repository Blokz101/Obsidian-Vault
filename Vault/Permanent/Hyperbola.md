- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-08-24 13.59.06.excalidraw|150]]
	- Orientation
		- You can tell the orientation by looking at which variable(x or y) is part of the positive fraction. **If y is part of the positive fraction then it is vertical** and **if x is part of the positive function then it is horizontal**.
		- Vertical
			- $\large{\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}=1}$
		- Horizontal
			- $\large{\frac{(x-k)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-h)^2}{b^2}=1}$
	- You can identify a [[Hyperbola]] by the fact that one of the fractions that contain x and y is negative and both x and y are squared. In an [[Ellipse]] both fractions will be positive. 
- ## Reference
	- Equation is exactly the same as an [[Ellipse]] except for the negative.
