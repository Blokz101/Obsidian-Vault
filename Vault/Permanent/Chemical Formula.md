#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- Definition
	- The formula that tells us what [[Element|Elements]] make up a substance.
	  > [!Example]
	  > $$C_2H_5OH$$
- Extracting Information 
	- [[Mole|Moles]]
		- We can easily determine how many [[Mole|Moles]] of each [[Element]] there are.
		  > [!Example]
		  > Using the formula above:
		  > $$C_2H_5OH$$
		  > In one mole of this compound there are:
		  > - $2moles$ of C
		  > - $6moles$ of H
		  > - $1mole$ of O
	- [[Mass]]
		- Using the moles that we determined above we can use the [[Molar Mass]] of each [[Element]] to determine the [[Mass]] of one [[Mole]] of a compound.
			1. Get a list of the [[Mole|Moles]] of each [[Element]] in the [[Compound]].
			2. Find the [[Molar Mass]] of each [[Element]] in the [[Compound]].
			3. Multiple the number of [[Mole|Moles]] of each [[Element]] with its [[Molar Mass]].
			4. Add the results for each [[Element]] for the [[Compound]] [[Mass]].

			   > Using the formula above:
		       > $$C_2H_5OH$$
		       > List the moles
		       > - $2moles$ of C
		       > - $6moles$ of H
		       > - $1mole$ of O
		       > Find the molar mass of each element
		       > - 
	- Number of [[Atom|Atoms]]
