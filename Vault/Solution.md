#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	-  A [[Mixture|Homogeneous Mixture]] composed of a [[Solute]] dissolved in a [[Solvent]].
	- When water is the [[Solute]] it is called an [[Aqueous Solution]].
- ## Solution Process
	- When a [[Solute]] is placed in a [[Solvent]] the forces between the [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] are stronger then the forces between the [[Solvent]] and itself.
	- The [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] break the [[Solvent]] [[Solvent]] bonds to form bonds between [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]].
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $\large{\Delta G \approx \Delta H_{solution}=(\Delta H_{solvent} + \Delta H_{solvent}) + \Delta H_{mixture}}$
		- $\Delta H_{solvent}$ and $\Delta H_{solvent}$ will be **greater than zero** individually as their bonds to themselves are broken in favor of the [[Solvent]] [[Solvent]] bonds.
		- $\Delta H_{mixture}$ will be **less then zero** as bonds are formed between the mixture of [[Solvent]] and [[Solvent]].
		- Because $\Delta G \approx \Delta H_{solution}$, if $\Delta H_{solution}$ is **less the zero** then the [[Solvent]] is **soluble** and the dissolution process occurs [[Spontaneity|Spontaneously]].
