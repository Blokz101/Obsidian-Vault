#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	-  A [[Mixture|Homogeneous Mixture]] composed of a [[Solute]] dissolved in a [[Solvent]].
	- When water is the [[Solute]] it is called an [[Aqueous Solution]].
- ## Solution Process Idea
	- #### Main Idea
		- When a [[Solute]] is placed in a [[Solvent]] the forces between the [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] are stronger then the forces between the [[Solvent]] and itself.
		- The [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] break the [[Solvent]] [[Solvent]] bonds to form bonds between [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]].
	- #### Process IDea (See more in [[Writing Precipitation Reactions]])
		1. Two [[Solubility|Soluble]] [[Compound|Compounds]] dissolve into their separate [[Ion|Ions]] in a [[Solvent]].
		2. If any combination of the individual [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Solubility|Insoluble]] they form a precipitate and change [[States Of Matter]].
			- Because the other combinations are [[Solubility|Soluble]] they instantly dissolve if they try to form a precipitate.
		- > [!Example]
		  > Sodium Chloride reacting with Silver Nitrate:
		  > 
		  > Step 1: Dissolution reaction into [[Ion|Ions]]:
		  > $NaCl (s) \rightarrow Na^+ (aq) + Cl^- (aq)$
		  > $AgNO_3 (s) \rightarrow Ag^+ (aq) + NO_3^- (aq)$
		  > 
		  > Step 2: Check if any of the [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Solubility|Insoluble]] and will therefore be able to form a precipitate without getting instantly dissolved again:
		  > $NaNO_3$ is [[Solubility|Soluble]]
		  > $AgCl$ is [[Solubility|Insoluble]]
		  > $Ag^+$ and $Cl^-$ will be able to form a precipitate.
		  > 
		  > Step 3: Write the [[Net Equation]]
		  > $Ag^+(ag)+Cl^-(ag)\rightarrow AgCl(s)$
	- #### Connection To [[Free Energy]] and [[Enthalpy]]
		- > [!Equation]
		  > Assume that $\Delta S \approx 0$:
		  > 
		  > $$\large{\Delta G \approx \Delta H_{solution}=(\Delta H_{solvent} + \Delta H_{solvent}) + \Delta H_{mixture}}$$
		- $\Delta H_{solvent}$ and $\Delta H_{solvent}$ will be **greater than zero** individually as their bonds to themselves are broken in favor of the [[Solvent]] [[Solvent]] bonds.
		- $\Delta H_{mixture}$ will be **less then zero** as bonds are formed between the mixture of [[Solvent]] and [[Solvent]].
		- Because $\Delta G \approx \Delta H_{solution}$, if $\Delta H_{solution}$ is **less the zero** then the [[Solvent]] is **soluble** and the dissolution process occurs [[Spontaneity|Spontaneously]].
	- #### All of this depends on the [[Solubility]] of the [[Molecule|Molecules]].
