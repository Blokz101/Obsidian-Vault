#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	-  A [[Mixture|Homogeneous Mixture]] composed of a [[Solute]] dissolved in a [[Solvent]].
	- When water is the [[Solute]] it is called an [[Aqueous Solution]].
- ## Solution Process
	- When a [[Solute]] is placed in a [[Solvent]] the forces between the [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] are stronger then the forces between the [[Solvent]] and itself.
	- The [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] break the [[Solvent]] [[Solvent]] bonds to form bonds between [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]].
	- $\Delta H$ of the [[Solute]] and [[Solvent]] both increase 
- ## Reference
	- [[Solution]] is a type of [[Mixture|Homogeneous Mixture]].
