#Permanent [[Calculus]]

- ## Definition
	- A type of [[Function]] in witch each y value cannot point to the same x value.
	  > [!Example]
	  > Example of One to One: Standard lines, Exponential, etc
	  > Not an example of One to One: Parabola, etc
	  > 
	  > Think [[Vertical Line Test]] but horizontal.
	- You can algebraically prove that a [[Function]] is [[One to One]] by setting the equation equal to itself but with each $x$ replaced with $y$ and solving until you get $x=y$.
	  > [!Example]
	  > $$f(x)=\frac{x-3}{x+2}$$
	  > $\frac{x-3}{x+2}=\frac{y-3}{y+2}$
	  > $(y+2)(x-3)=(y-3)(x+2)$
	  > $yx+2x-3y-6=yx-3x+2y-6$
	  > $2x-3y=-3x+2y$
	  > $2x+3x=2y+3y$
	  > $5x=5y$
	  > $x=y$
	  > 
	  > Therefore the function is [[One to One]]
