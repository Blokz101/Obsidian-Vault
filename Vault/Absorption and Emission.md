- ## Definition
	- [[Electron|Electrons]] can jump from energy level to energy level.
		- When it **absorbs** energy it jumps from a **lower energy level to a higher one**.
		- When it **releases** energy it drops from a **higher energy level to a lower one** and  emits [[Energy]] in the form of [[Spectrum of Light|Light]] at a specific [[Frequency]].

		  > 
		  > $E$ = [[Energy]] (J)
	      > $h$ = [[Planck's Equation]] = $6.626e-34$ ($Js$).
		  > $R$ = [[Rydberg's Constant]] = $3.29e15$ ($s^{-1}$)
	      > $n_{lo}$ = Energy Level (integer) that is the lowest.
	      > $n_{hi}$ = Energy Level (integer) that is the highest.
