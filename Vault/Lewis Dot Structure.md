#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^935dc7
	- A method of drawing compounds that shows how its [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]] combine to form a **octet** for each [[Element]].
		- Except for Hydrogen, which only needs two [[Electron|Electrons]] to reach a stable state.
	- Two [[Electron|Electrons]] shared between two [[Element|Elements]] is represented by a dash.

	- > [!Warning]
	  > Never use this to represent an [[Ionic Compound|Ionic Bond]]
- ## Determining the Structure
	1. Find the number of **[[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]] required** for each [[Atom]] to have an **octet**.
	2. Find how many [[Valence Electron]] you have currently by adding the
