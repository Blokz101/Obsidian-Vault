#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition ^935dc7
	- A method of drawing compounds that shows how its [[Valence Electron|Valence Electrons]] combine to form a **octet** for each [[Element]].
		- Except for Hydrogen, which only needs two [[Electron|Electrons]] to reach a stable state.
	- Two [[Electron|Electrons]] shared between two [[Element|Elements]] is represented by a dash.

	- > [!Warning]
	  > Never use this to represent an [[Ionic Compound|Ionic Bond]]
- ## Determining the Structure
	1. Find the number of [[Valence Electrons]] required for each [[Atom]] needs to have an **octet**.
	   - > [!Equation]
	   > $$e^-required=2H+8E$$
	   > $e^-required$ = [[Valence Electron]] required
	   > $H$ = Number of **Hydrogen** atoms in the [[Compound]]
	   > $E$ = Number of other [[Element|Elements]] in the [[Compound]]
	2. Find how many [[Valence Electron]] you have currently have.
		1. Add the num
- ## Reference
	- Used to draw [[Covalent Compound|Covalent Bonds]].
