#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- States that the relationship between [[Temperature]] and [[Volume]] is directly proportional.
	- > [!Equation]
	> $$t_1v_1=t_2v_2$$
	> 
	> $t_1$ = First [[Temperature]] in [[Temperature|K]].
	> $v_1$ = First  [[Volume]] in [[Volume|L]].
	> $t_2$ = Second [[Temperature]] in [[Temperature|K]].
	> $v_2$ = Second [[Volume]] in [[Volume|L]].
