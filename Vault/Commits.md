- ## How to write a good commit
	- [Based on this video](https://youtu.be/Uszj_k0DGsg)
	- How to create a good commit
		- Be selective about what goes into a commit.
			- Group changes by topic into one commit.
			- As commits become larger, try to separate them.
			- The staging area can be used to select what changes to commit, [[Commit Part of a File]].
		- Leave a good commit message
			- The subject should be a quick summary of what happened
				- Should be less then 80 characters
			- The body should be more detailed
				- What is now different?
				- What is the reason?
				- Anything remarkable?
