#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- States that the relationship between the number of [[Mole|Moles]] and [[Volume]] is directly proportional.
	 - > [!Equation]
	> $$n_1v_1=n_2v_2$$
	> 
	> $n_1$ = First amount in [[Mole|Moles]].
	> $v_1$ = First  [[Volume]] in [[Volume|L]].
	> $n_2$ = Second amount in [[Mole|Moles]].
	> $v_2$ = Second [[Volume]] in [[Volume|L]].
- ## Reference
	- Can be derived from the [[Ideal Gas Law]].
