# Terminal Resistance
#Perm [[Electricity]] [[Resistance]]

- Definition
	- The terminal resistance is the resistance of the electrical path between the two motor terminals. 
- How to measure
	- Because R is usually small, a common Ohmmeter is not suitable.
	- [[Ohm's Law]] is commonly used instead ^f0a44f
		1. Fix the end of the motor shaft so it cannot move
		2. Apply a moderate voltage to the motor
		3. Simultaneously measure the actual [[Current]] and [[Voltage]]
		4. Use [[Ohm's Law]] to calculate the resistance
		5. Do this several times with the motor shaft in different positions to ensure an accurate measurement
