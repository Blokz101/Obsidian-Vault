## Calculating [[Power|Mechanical Power]]
1. >[!Equation for rotational mechanical power]
   >$$P_{rot}=T*W$$
   >$P_{rot}$ = Rotational mechanical power
   >$T$ = [[Torque]]
   >$W$ = [[Angular Velocity]] in radians per second
2. The angular velocity given above is in radians per second so conversion from rpm may be needed. This can be done with the formula below.
	1. >[!Equation to convert from rpm to rad/sec]
	   > $$W_{rad/sec}=W_{rpm}*\frac{2\pi}{60}$$
	   > $W_{rad/sec}$ = [[Angular Velocity]] in radians per second
	   > $W_{rpm}$ = [[Angular Velocity]] in rotations per minute
