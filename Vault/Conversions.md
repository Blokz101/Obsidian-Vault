- ## Definition
	- Used to convert from one unit of measure to another
- ## Process - [Useful Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQXGvCmt4oQ)
	1. Set up the original unit of measure as a fraction.
	   > [!Example]
	   > $100mph$ -> $\frac{100miles}{1hour}$
	2. Find the appropriate [[Conversion Factor]] that converts between the current unit and a desired unit. Often they have to chained together to achieve the desired result.
	3. Set up each conversion so that one of the units between the two fractions cancel out. 
	   > [!Example]
	   > $\frac{100miles}{1hour}*\frac{1hour}{60seconds}$
	4. Solve.
	   >[!Example]
	   >$\frac{100miles}{1hour}*\frac{1hour}{60seconds}=\frac{100miles}{60seconds}=1.6mps$
	5. Repeat 2 though 4 until the desired unit is reached.
	   
	   > [!Example]
	   > **A sample of $C_3H_8$ contains $6.55*10^{23}$ hydrogen atoms. How many grams of carbon are in this sample?**
	   > $6.55*10^{23}atomsH*\frac{1moleH}{6.02e23atomsH}*\frac{3molesC}{8molesH}*\frac{12.011gramsC}{1moleC}=4.9gramsC$
