#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- ![[Drawing 2022-09-03 19.15.45.excalidraw|400]]
	- The same as the [[Rutherford's Model]] but with **6** defined **energy levels** that the [[Electron|Electrons]] must orbit on. 
	- Significant because it showed that [[Electron|Electrons]] move in quantized[^1] [[Energy]] transitions.
- ## Interactions
	- [[Electron|Electrons]] can jump from level to level and when they do they emit [[Spectrum of Light|Light]].
	- The [[Energy]] of an [[Electron]] any orbit around a [[Nucleus]] will have negative [[Energy]] compared an [[Electron]] that is not in orbit.
- ## Experiment
	- 
- ## Reference
	- A current model of the [[Atom]], however it only applies to the [[Element]] **Hydrogen**.
