#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- An instrument for measuring [[Pressure]].
	- ![[IMG_C1AE4CBCA7AE-1.jpeg|300]]
	- As the [[Pressure]] changes it compresses or decompresses the trapped gas and moves the liquid level accordingly.
	- You can determine the [[Pressure]] using the following formula:
		> [!Equation]
		> $$p_{outside}=p_{gas}-\Delta h$$
		> 
		> **$p_{outside}$** = Outside [[Gas]] [[Pressure]] in [[Pressure|mm hg]].
		> **$p_{gas}$** = Trapped [[Gas]] [[Pressure]] in [[Pressure|mm hg]].
		> **$\Delta h$** = Difference between the liquid level in contact with the outside and the liquid level in contact with the trapped gas in (mm).
		> - If the level of the outside liquid is higher then the level of the inside liquid then  **$\Delta h$** negative
		> - If the level of the inside liquid is higher then the level of the outside liquid then  **$\Delta h$** is positive.
