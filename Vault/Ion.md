#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- **[[Ion|Ions]] are always [[Charge|charged]], never neutral**
		- The number of [[Proton|Protons]] in an [[Ion]] is constant, however [[Electron|Electrons]] can be added or removed. Given the [[Element]] and charge you can determine the number of [[Electron|Electrons]] the [[Ion]] has
		  > [!Example]
		  > $$Cl^{1-}$$
		  > Cl is element #17 so it will have 17 [[Proton|Protons]], to give it a charge of $-1$ it will have to have 18 [[Electron|Electrons]].
	- An [[Ion|Ions]] charge always appears as subscript to its [[Ion]]. Ex $Fe^{3+}$, $Cl^{1-}$, $NH_4^{1+}$, $SO_4^{2-}$.
- ## [[Ion|Cation]] vs [[Ion|Anion]]
	- If it is neutral it is an [[Atom]].
	- Positively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Cations]].
	- Negatively charged [[Ion|Ions]] are [[Ion|Anions]]. 
- ![[Isotope#^5b210c]]
- ## Reference
	- [[Monoatomic Ion]] is a type of [[Ion]].
	- [[Polyatomic Ions]] is a type of [[Ion]].
