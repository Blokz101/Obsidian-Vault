#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Every [[Process]] (throwing a ball, boiling water, burning wood) has two states: Initial and Final. They can be split into [[Process|Processes]]:
		- [[Endothermic Process]]
		- [[Exothermic Process]] 
	- [[Process|Processes]] can also be split by what they effect:
		- [[Physical Process]]
			- Does not chemically change anything. Can be undone relatively easily.
			  > [!Example]
			  > Heating up a pot of water, nothing is chemically changed though energy was added.
		- [[Chemical Reaction|Chemical Process]] or [[Chemical Reaction]] 
			- Chemically change the [[Reactant|Reactants]]. Harder to undo.
			  > [!Example]
			  > Burning a piece of paper chemically changes the paper into ash. Energy is released.
