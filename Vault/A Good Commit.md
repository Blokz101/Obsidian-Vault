# A Good Commit
[[Git]]

[Based on this video](https://youtu.be/Uszj_k0DGsg)
- How to create a good commit
	- Be selective about what goes into a commit.
		- Group changes by topic into one commit.
		- As commits become larger, try to separate them.
		- The staging area can be used to select what changes to commit, [[Commit Part of a File]].
	- Leave a good commit message
		- The subject should be a quick summary of what happened
			- Should be less then 80 characters
		- The body should be more detailed
			- What is now different?
			- What is the reason?
			- Anything remarkable?
