# A Good Commit
[Git]

[Based on this video](https://youtu.be/Uszj_k0DGsg)
- Be selective about what goes into a commit.
	- Group changes by topic into one commit.
	- As commits become larger, try to separate them.
	- The staging area can be used to select what changes to commit, [[even specific changes from a file]].
