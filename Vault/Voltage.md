# Voltage
[[Electricity]]

Voltage is the difference in electrical potential of electrons between two points. 
>[!example]
>The positive side of a battery has atomic nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons, the negative side has the electrons. There is a massive electrical potential difference of electrons as the electrons attempt to find a way to get to the nuclei.

Voltage is related to [[Current]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
