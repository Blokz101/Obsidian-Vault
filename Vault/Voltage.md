#Permanent [[Electricity]]

- Definition
	- [[Voltage]] is the difference in electrical potential of Electrons between two points.
	- For example, the positive side of a battery has atomic nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons, the negative side has the electrons. There is a massive electrical potential difference of electrons as the electrons attempt to find a way to get to the nuclei.

- Symbol
	- $V$

Voltage is related to [[Current]] with [[Ohm's Law]].
