- ## Notes
	- There are four measurable properties of [[Gas|Gases]]:
		- [[Pressure]]
		- [[Volume]]
		- [[Temperature]]
		- Amount in [[Mole|Moles]]
	- There are several laws that bind the properties together:
		- [[Boyle's Law]] - [[Pressure]] and [[Volume]] is inversely proportional
		- [[Charles' Law]] - [[Temperature]] and [[Volume]] is directly proportional
		- [[Avogadro's Law]] - The number of [[Mole|Moles]] and [[Volume]] is directly proportional
	When they are combined they form the [[Ideal Gas Law]].
