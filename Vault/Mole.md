#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- Basic counting unit used in all sciences. The standard unit of measure across all others.
	- Was created to represent [[Avogadro's Number]] of something. 
		- One [[Mole]] of an [[Atom]] is [[Avogadro's Number]] of [[Atom|Atoms]]. 
		- One [[Mole]] of marbles is [[Avogadro's Number]] of marbles.
- ## Notes
	- Useful because we want to keep track of the number of [[Atom|Atoms]] in a reaction not the mass, as grams would measure it. 
	- Quantifying a [[Mole]]
		- There are [[Avogadro's Number]] of [[Atom|Atoms]] a [[Mole]]
		- The mass of a [[Mole]] is called the [[Molar Mass]] and different for each [[Element]]. It can be found on the [[Periodic Table]].
- ## Conversions
	- To convert from [[Mole|Moles]] to other units we commonly use [[Avogadro's Number]] or [[Molar Mass]] as a [[Conversion Factor]].
	  > [!Example]
	  > **What is the mass of 2.65 mole sample of copper?**
	  > Copper has a molar mass of $63.546grams$, therefor:
	  > $$2.65moleCu*\frac{36.546gramsCu}{1moleCu}=168gramsCu$$
	  > 
	  > **How many moles of aluminum do $4.90*10^{22}$ aluminum atoms represent?**
	  > $$4.90*10^{22}atomsAl*\frac{1moleAl}{6.02*10^{23}atomsAl}=8.14*10^{-2}molesAl$$
