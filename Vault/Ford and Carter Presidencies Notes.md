# Ford and Carter Presidencies Notes
> [[American History]]
## Gerald Ford
Became president after [[Richard Nixon]] resigned due to the [[Watergate Scandal]].

At this time the nation was in a horrible economic state, inflation and unemployment were on the rise. The [[OPEC]] oil-price increases only make the situation worse.

The first action Ford took was to grant an official pardon to Nixon in an attempt to help the nation move past the scandal. The move cost him a lot of public support.

## [[Jimmy Carter]]
The democratic candidate for president in the 1976 election, he beat Ford by a narrow margin.

He was a previously unknown peanut farmer and former governor of Georgia and portrayed himself as a very honest man. His campaign centered around restoring integrity to the nation’s highest office.

## The Energy Crisis
[[OPEC]] stands for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries

Making the economic situation worse OPEC announced another major price increase in the late 1970s.

These rising fuel prices pushed Carter to act. He attempted an array of measures, but was ultimately unsuccessful. His failure stirred a feeling of unease among the public and a feeling that Carter didnt have a national policy to help.

Soon after Carter gave his now famous [[Malaise Speech]] where he complained about the "spirit of crisis" that had struck at the very heart and soul of the nation's will. This speech made many feel that their president had given up.

## [[Iran Hostage Crisis]]
The Shah of Iran is the leader of the government in Iran and an ally of America. He was not popular with the people due to the use of widespread corruption and deceitful tactics.

In January 1979 his people revolted. Lead by the Muslim religious leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] they over threw the Shah. America supported the Shah until the very end.

In October of the same year Carter allowed the Shah entry into America for cancer treatment. This move outraged the revolutionaries of Iran.

On November 4, 1979 a series of armed students attacked a US embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage. They demanded that Carter turn over the Shah in exchange for the release of the hostages.

Carter refused and a 444 day long stand off ensued while America attempted to free the hostages. It wasnt until shortly after the new president, Ronald Reagan, started his term that the hostages were finally freed. 

This entire situation made many Americans realize that there were very real limits on US power and limits on her natural resources. This prompted a spur of environmentalist activity.

## [[Camp Davis Accords]]
[[Camp Davis]] is a military instillation and presidential retreat in Maryland.

The Camp Davis Accords are a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. Carter initiated the peace negotiations and after 12 days of intense debate they emerged with the Camp Davis Accords. 

Israel agreed to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had seized from Egypt during the Six-Day War in 1967. Egypt, in turn, formally recognized Israel’s right to exist.

## [[Three Mile Island]]
A reactor at a plant on Three Mile Island near Harrisburg malfunctioned. The reactor overheated after its cooling system failed and concerns that radiation would leak out quickly arose.

Shortly after, low levels of radiation were detected outside of the crippled reactor and many moved out in a panic and the people who remained were told to take safety precautions.

A demand was made for the government to halt construction of reactors and gradually retire the active ones. Though the government did not comply with this, they did recognize the hazard that the reactors could pose. Safety standards were improved along with inspections.
