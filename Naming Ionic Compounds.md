#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Steps (If the molecule has a [[Transition Metal]])
	1. List the [[Non-Metal]] last and give it the postfix **-ide**.
	2. Put the [[Oxidation State]] of the [[Transition Metal]] in () and in roman numerals in front of the [[Transition Metal]].

	- > [!Explanation]-
	  > We place the [[Oxidation State]] in front of the [[Transition Metal]] because they can have so many [[Oxidation State|Oxidation Numbers]], basically we have to specify what that number is.
- ## Exceptions
	- $Zn^{2+}$, $Ag^{+}$, $Cd^{2+}$ Each have a single [[Oxidation State]] and therefore  do not need that state specified after it. Simply change the postfix of the [[Non-Metal]] to **-ide**.
- ## Reference
	- Know what a [[Transition Metal]] is.
