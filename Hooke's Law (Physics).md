- ## Definition
	- States that the force that a sprint exerts is directly proportional to how much it is stretched.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{\vec{F}_{spring}=-ks\hat{L}}$$
	  >$$\large{s=|\vec{L}|-L_{0}}$$
	  >
	  >$\vec{F}_{net}$ = The [[Force]] that the spring exerts in $N$
	  >$k$ = Spring constant
	  >$s$ = Displacement in $m$
	  >$L$ = Current Length in $m$
	  >$L_{0}$ = Resting Length in $m$
	  >$\hat{L}$ = [[Unit Vector]] of [[Displacement]] direction
	- To just find the magnitude you can ignore the direction entirely:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{|\vec{F}_{net}|=k*|s|}$$
		  > $$\large{s=|\vec{L}|-L_{0}}$$
		  > 
		  > $|\vec{F}_{net}|$ = [[Magnitude]] of the [[Force]] that the spring exerts in $N$
		  > $k$ = Sprint Constant
		  > $s$ = [[Displacement]] in $m$
