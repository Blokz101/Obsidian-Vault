- ## Definition
	- A line passing through two points on a curve.
	- The [[Slope]] of a [[Secant Line]] is derived from the equation for [[Slope]] where: 
		- $y_2$ is $f(x+h)$
		- $y_1$ is $f(x)$
		- $x_2-x_1$ is $h$.
		  
    > [!Equation]
    > $$m=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
    > 
    > $m$ = [[Slope]]
    > $h$ = The x-axis difference between the two points. ^7b00b6
