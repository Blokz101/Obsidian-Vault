- ## Definition
	- The goal is to shift and scale a signal $f(t)$ so that it matches another signal $g(t)$. To do so, find the unknown values in this equation:
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{g(t)=f(\alpha t-t_{0})=f\left( \alpha\left( t-\frac{t_{0}}{\alpha} \right) \right)}$$
	  > 
	  > Unknowns:
	  > - $\alpha$ = Value to scale by
	  > - $t_{0}$ = Value to shift by
	- There are two methods.
		- Shift and Scale
			- Use the first equation: $g(t)=$
