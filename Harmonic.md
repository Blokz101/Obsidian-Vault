- ## Definition
	- A [[Harmonic]] in a [[Fourier Series]] is a single [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)|Cosine Wave]] in the infinite summation.
	- All [[Harmonic|Harmonics]] after the [[Fundamental Frequency]] must be **integer** multiples of the [[Fundamental Frequency]].

	  > $f_{n}$ = [[Harmonic]] $n$ in $Hz$
	  > $n$ = Integer multiple
	  > $f_{0}$ = [[Fundamental Frequency]] in $Hz$
