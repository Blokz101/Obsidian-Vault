- ## Definition
	- A [[Harmonic]] in a [[Fourier Series]] is a single [[Cosine Wave (Signals, Circuits, and Systems)|Cosine Wave]] in the infinite summation.
	- All [[Harmonic|Harmonics]] after the [[Fundamental Frequency]] must be **integer** multiples of the [[Fundamental Frequency]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{f_{n}=nf_{0}}$$
	  > $f_{n}$ = [[Harmonic]] $n$ in $Hz$
	  > $n$ = Integer multiple
	  > $f_{0}$ = [[Fundamental Frequency]] in $Hz$
	  > > [!Example]
	  >> The fifth [[Harmonic]] would be $5*f_{0}\,Hz$
