- ## Definition
	- Then there exists one number $x$ on the interval $(a,b)$ such that $f(x)=N$ assuming the following:
		- $f(x)$ is [[Continuity|Continuous]] on the closed interval $[a,b]$.
		- $f(a)â‰ f(b)$
		- $N$ is any [[Real Number]] on the interval $(a,b)$
	 > [!Warning]
	 > $a$, $b$, and $N$ are numbers on the $x$ axis.
	- Useful for proving that roots exists in place.
