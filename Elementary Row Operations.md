- ## Definition
	- Primary manipulations that can be performed on a [[Matrix]] to obtain [[Matrix Inverse|Inverse]].
	- The [[Elementary Row Operations]] and:
		- Swapping two rows.
		- Multiplying or dividing a row by a non zero scalar.
		- Multiply or dividing a row by a non zero scaler and adding it to another row.
	- Each of these [[Elementary Row Operations]] can be achieved by multiplying a [[Matrix]] by another specific [[Matrix]].
		-  Swapping two rows is equivalent to multiplying the [[Matrix]] by:
	
  $$\begin{matrix}
  0 0 1
  0 1 0
  1 0 0
\end{matrix}$$
