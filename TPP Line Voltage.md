- ## Definition
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] refers to the [[Voltage]] between two individual lines of a system that uses [[Three Phase Power]].
		- > [!Example]
		  > $\large{\tilde{V}_{ab}}$ is the [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Voltage]] between lines $a$ and $b$ **BEFORE** the line resistances.
	- [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Voltage]] can be solved for with [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}_{ab}=\tilde{V}_{an}*\sqrt{ 3 }\angle 30}$$
