- ## Definition
	- This note uses [[Voltage]], but the same information applies to [[Current]].
	- [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] refers to the [[Voltage]] between two individual lines of a system that uses [[Three Phase Power]].
		- In easier terms, line to line [[Voltage]].
	- > [!Example]
	  > $\large{\tilde{V}_{ab}}$ is the [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Voltage]] between lines $a$ and $b$ **BEFORE** the line resistances.
	- [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Voltage]] can be solved for with [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]].
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{\tilde{V}_{ab}=\tilde{V}_{an}*\sqrt{ 3 }\angle 30\degree}$$
		  > $\tilde{V}_{ab}$ = [[TPP Line Voltage|Line Voltage]] from line $a$ to $b$ in $V$
		  > $\tilde{V}_{an}$ = [[TPP Phase Voltage|Phase Voltage]] on line $a$ from node $n$ to $a$ in $V$.
