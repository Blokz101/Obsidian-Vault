- ## In an Conductor
	- [[Conductor|Conductors]] have very mobile [[Electron|Electrons]], they allow their [[Electron|Electrons]] to move freely. When placed in an [[Electric Field]] their [[Electron|Electrons]] gather on one side and their [[Proton|Protons]] gather on the other.

- ## In an Insulator
	- [[Insulator|Insulators]] do not have mobile [[Electron|Electrons]], there are strong bonds between the [[Electron|Electrons]] and their [[Nucleus|Nuclei]]. When placed in an [[Electric Field]] each molecule turns into an [[Induced Dipole]].
