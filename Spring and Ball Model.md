- ## Definition
	- A way to model the configuration of [[Atom|Atoms]] in a **Solid** by assuming that each [[Atom]] is a small sphere connected with **springs** to the [[Atom|Atoms]] adjacent to it.

	- One of the main things that we want to do is find the "length" of each "spring". This is so we can calculate things like the stretch of **springs in parallel**.

	- Use [[Avogadro's Number]] and basic math to solve for things like bond length. Examples are below in the practice.
