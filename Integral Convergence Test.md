- ## Definition
	- We know that an [[Infinite Series]] will follow the same path as the [[Integral]] of that [[Infinite Series|Series]] from some number to infinity.

	- So we can use the [[Integral]] of $a_{n}$ to determine **convergence**.

	- > We are not always able to find the sum of a convergent series, but when we use the integral test to determine convergence, we are able to estimate the sum $S=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}a_{n}$.

	  >  Let $f(x)$ be a positive-valued continuous decreasing function on the interval $[1, \infty)$ such that $f(n)=a_{n}$. If the series $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}a_{n}$ **converges**, then:
