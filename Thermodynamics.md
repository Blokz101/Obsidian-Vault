#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and its transformations.
- ## Laws of [[Thermodynamics]]
	- #### First Law of Thermodynamics
		- [[Energy]] can never be created or destroyed, only changed.
			- [[Work]] and [[Heat]] can be transformed into one another.
			- > [!Equation]
			> $$\Delta E_{system}+\Delta E_{surrounding}=0$$
			> 
			> $\Delta E_{universe}$ = [[Energy]] in the system.
			> $\Delta E_{surrounding}$ = [[Energy]] in the surroundings.
			- If the **system** wants to absorb [[Energy]] then the **surroundings** must give up that [[Energy]] to maintain an equilibrium.
