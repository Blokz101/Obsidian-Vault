#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy (Chemistry)]] and its transformations.
- ## First Law of Thermodynamics
	- [[Energy (Chemistry)]] can never be created or destroyed, only changed.
		- [[Work (Chemistry)]] and [[Heat]] can be transformed into one another.
		- > [!Equation]
                > $$\Delta E_{universe} = \Delta E_{system}+\Delta E_{surrounding}=0$$
                > 
                > $\Delta E_{universe}$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] of the **system** and its **surroundings**.
                > $\Delta E_{system}$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] in the system.. .  â€‹                > $\Delta E_{surrounding}$ = [[Energy (Chemistry)]] in the surroundings.
	- If the **system** wants to absorb [[Energy (Chemistry)]] then the **surroundings** must give up that [[Energy (Chemistry)]] to maintain an equilibrium.
- ## Second Law Of Thermodynamics
	- [[Entropy]] must be **greater than zero for all [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] processes**.
		- > [!Equation]
                 > $$\Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{system} + \Delta S_{surrounding}>0$$
                 > 
                 > $\Delta S_{universe}$ = [[Entropy]] of the **system** and its **surroundings**.
                 > $\Delta S_{system}$ = [[Entropy]] in the system.
                 > $\Delta S_{surrounding}$ = [[Entropy]] in the surroundings.
                 
             
	  - The universe will always keep getting more chaotic until its heat death.
	- Reworking the **Second Law** and substituting in [[Entropy]], we can predict wether a reaction will be [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] or [[Spontaneity|Non-Spontaneous]].

		- A **negative $\Delta H$**, or **positive $\Delta S$** contributes to making **$\Delta G$ negative** or the reaction [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]].
		- If **$\Delta G$** is positive then the reaction can still be [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] but would **happen in reverse**. The reactants becoming the products and the products becoming the reactants.
