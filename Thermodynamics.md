#Permanent [[Chemistry]]

- ## Definition
	- The study of [[Energy]] and its transformations.
- ## Laws of [[Thermodynamics]]
	- #### First Law of Thermodynamics
		- [[Energy]] can never be created or destroyed, only changed.
			- [[Work]] and [[Heat]] can be transformed into one another.
			- > [!Equation]
			> $$\Delta E_{universe} = \Delta E_{system}+\Delta E_{surrounding}=0$$
			> 
			> $\Delta E_{universe}$ = [[Energy]] of the **system** and its **surroundings**.
			> $\Delta E_{system}$ = [[Energy]] in the system.
			> $\Delta E_{surrounding}$ = [[Energy]] in the surroundings.
			- If the **system** wants to absorb [[Energy]] then the **surroundings** must give up that [[Energy]] to maintain an equilibrium.
		- #### Second Law Of Thermodynamics
			- [[Entropy]] must be **greater than zero for all spontaneous processes**.
				- > [!Equation]
			  > $$\Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{system} + \Delta S_{surrounding}>0$$
			  > 
			  > $\Delta S_{universe}$ = [[Entropy]] of the **system** and its **surroundings**.
			  > $\Delta S_{system}$ = [[Entropy]] in the system.
			  > $\Delta S_{surrounding}$ = [[Entropy]] in the surroundings.
			  - The universe will always keep getting more chaotic until its heat death.
			- Reworking the **Second Law** and substituting in [[Entropy]], we can predict wether a reaction will be **spontaneous** or **non-spontaneous**.
				- > [!Equation]
				> $$\Delta G = \Delta H_{system}-T\Delta S_{system} < 0$$
				> $\Delta G$ = [[Free Energy]] in [[Energy|J]].
				> $T$ = 
				> $\Delta H$ = [[Enthalpy]] in [[]]
				> $\Delta S$ = [[Entropy]]
				> 
				> > [!Proof]

				> > $\Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{system} + \Delta S_{surrounding}>0$|Second Law
				> > $\Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{system} + -\frac{\Delta H_{system}}{T_{system}}>0$|Substitute $\Delta S_{surrounding}$ for $-\frac{\Delta H_{system}}{T_{system}}$.
				> > $-T_{system}\Delta S_{universe} = -T_{system}\Delta S_{system} + \Delta H_{system}<0$|Multiply everything by $-T_{system}$.
				> > $\Delta G = \Delta H_{system}-T\Delta S_{system}<0$|Substitute in $\Delta G$.
