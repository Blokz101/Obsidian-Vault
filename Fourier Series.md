- ## Definition
	- Any [[Periodic Signal]] can be represented as an infinite sum of **Sinusoids** with varying [[Amplitude|Amplitudes]], [[Frequency|Frequencies]], and [[Phase Angle|Phases]]. This summation of signals is called a [[Fourier Series]].
	  > [!Equation]
	  > $$\large{V(t)=V_{dc}+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}V_{p\,n}\cos(2\pi f_{n}t+\theta_{n})}$$
	  > 
	  >  $V(t)$ = [[Voltage]] at time $t$ of any [[Periodic Signal]] $V$
	  >  $t$ = Time in $s$
	  > $V_{DC}$ = [[Average Voltage]] in $V$
	  > $V_{p\,n}$ = [[Amplitude]] of [[Harmonic]] $n$ in $V$
	  > $f_{n}$ = [[Frequency]] of [[Harmonic]] $n$ in $\frac{1}{s}$
	  > $\theta_{n}$ = [[Phase Angle|Phase]] of [[Harmonic]] $n$ in $s$
	- > [!Example]
	  > The progressive sum of the first four non-zero [[Harmonic|Harmonics]] of a [[Square Wave]].
