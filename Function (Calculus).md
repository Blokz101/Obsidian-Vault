- ## Definition
	- A paring between two [[Set|Sets]] in witch every [[Element]] of the first [[Set]] is paired with **exactly** one [[Element]] of the second [[Set]].
	  > [!Example]
	  > x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
	  > ---|---|---|---|
	  > y | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3
	  > This is a function because each x value corresponds to exactly one y value.
	  
	  > [!Warning]
	  > No single x value can point to two different y values. This is the same concept as the [[Vertical Line Test]].
	  > 
	  > This is a function:
	  > 
	  > x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
	  > ---|---|---|---|
	  > y | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
	  > 
	  > This is not a function because -3 points to two values:
	  > {(3, 2), (-3, 1), (4, 2), (-3, 3)}
