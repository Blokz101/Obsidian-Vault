- ## Definition
	- To make [[Integral|Integration]] easier for radicals, we can use **substitutions** based on [[Pathergrans Theorem]].
	- We can write out **substitutions** for $\sqrt{ a^2-x^2 }$, $\sqrt{ x^2-a^2 }$, and $\sqrt{ a^2+x^2 }$.
	- > [!Equation]
	  > If we draw out a right triangle and label one side $x$ and the hypotenuse $a$, using [[Pathergrans Theorem]] we can deduce that the remaining side is $\sqrt{ a^2-x^2 }$.
