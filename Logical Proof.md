- ## Definition
	- A **theorem** is a [[Proposition]] that a [[Logical Proof]] seeks to prove.
	- A [[Logical Proof]] consists of a series of steps each of which follows logically from assumptions, or form previously proven statements, until the **theorem** is proven or disproven.
	- There are several methods to prove or disprove a **theorem**.
- #### Direct Proof
	- The standard kind of proof. Use the given hypotheses and proven logic to prove the conclusion true.
	- Proves $x\to y$ directly.

- #### Proof by Contrapositive 
	- Proves a statement by proving its [[Conditional Operator|Contrapositive]].
	- Proves $x\to y$ by proving $\neg y\to \neg x$.
	- Proving by [[Conditional Operator|Contrapositive]] is useful when [[Logical Proof|Direct Proofs]] are difficult.
