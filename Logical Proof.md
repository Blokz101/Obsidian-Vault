- ## Definition
	- A **theorem** is a [[Proposition]] that a [[Logical Proof]] seeks to prove.
	- A [[Logical Proof]] consists of a series of steps each of which follows logically from assumptions, or form previously proven statements, until the **theorem** is proven or disproven.
	- There are several methods to prove or disprove a **theorem**.
- #### Proof by Exhaustion
	- Used to prove something universally.
	- One of the easiest kinds of proofs, simply prove that the theorem is true for all variables for all variables in their respective domains.
- #### Contradiction by Counterexample
	- Used to disp
