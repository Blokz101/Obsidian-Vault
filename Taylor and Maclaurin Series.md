- ## Taylor Series
	- A [[Power Series]] in the form of:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > $$\large{f(x)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}c_{n}(x-a)^n}$$
	- After taking [[Derivative|Derivatives]] of the [[Taylor and Maclaurin Series|Taylor Series]] we see a pattern emerge. From that pattern we can derive:
		- > [!Equation]
		  > If $f(x)$ has [[Derivative|Derivatives]] of all orders $x=a$, then the [[Taylor and Maclaurin Series|Taylor Series]] of $f$ about $x=a$ is:
		  > $$\large{\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n}$$
		- This [[Infinite Series|Series]] does not have to **converge** anywhere other then $x=a$.
		- Generally a good place to sta
- ## Maclaurin Series
	- A [[Taylor and Maclaurin Series|Taylor Series]] where $a=0$.
